### Status:

Not yet implemented:

Cross-field checks:

If end up having a moseg.pro field to replace current MS22 (localized function) with FBto terms, should probably add a check that this field is only filled in if that field is filled in for the appropriate type of construct (e.g. enhancer trap)


- MS14c and MS14d generally not both filled in (not sure that is the case so not implemented yet)
