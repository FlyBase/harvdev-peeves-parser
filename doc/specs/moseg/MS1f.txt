### Status:

doc: checked that doc reflects what has been implemented


NOTE: at the moment, Peeves only knows about FBtp and not about the other types of feature (FBmc or FBms) which can be put in a moseg.pro, so if a proforma contains information about an FBmc or FBms, there will be both false-positive and missing error messages.
