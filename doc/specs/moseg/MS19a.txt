### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field, using 'check_valid_chado_symbol_field':

* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* checks value is a valid symbol of a FBtp or FBmc *in chado* (this requirement is because there are multiple possibilities for the 'type' of an FBtp in chado, which is needed when generating the feature_relationship between the value in MS19a and that in MS1a, and that information between proformae is not stored in the proforma parsing software (apart from keeping a record of the gene for alleles).

### Status:

Not yet implemented - might be helpful to include a hint of what to do (i.e. make .edit record in next phase) if need to fill this in with a new FBtp, but not completely trivial to do as not universal for all fields that use 'check_valid_chado_symbol_field', so have not done yet. Will add a note to the curation manual.
