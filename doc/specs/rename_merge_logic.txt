Renaming fields
===============

The gene renaming fields are the following.

! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :


Parsing rules
=============

The parsing rules are:

a) G1a must always contain a syntactically correct gene symbol.  It
must not be empty.

b)  G1e must either be empty, or contain a single symbol which must
exist as a valid gene symbol in Chado.

c) G1f must either be empty or contain a list of at least two gene
symbols, all different and given one per line, all of which must exist
as valid gene symbols in Chado.

d)  G1g must contain either y or n.  Its value will be used as a
data-consistency check on the value given in G1a.

e)  G31a must be blank or contain the single value y.

f)  G31b must be blank or contain the single value y.

g)  At least one of G1e and G1f must be blank.

    - if both are blank, neither a rename nor a merge occurs.

      - if G1a contains a symbol which is a valid gene symbol in Chado
        the data in the rest of the curation record is used to modify
        (i.e., augment, alter or remove) data already present in
        Chado.  In this case, G1g must contain the value y.

      - if G1a does not contain a symbol which is a valid gene symbol
        in Chado the data in the rest of the curation record is used
        to specify the data for a newly created gene record.  In this
        case, G1g must contain the value n.

    - if G1e has a value, the gene with the symbol given in G1e is
      renamed to the value given in G1a (which must not be the valid
      symbol of a gene already in Chado).  In this case, G1g must
      contain the value n.

    - if G1f contains data, all of the genes with the symbols given in
      G1f are merged into a single gene which will have for its valid
      symbol the value given in G1a.  In this case, G1g may contain
      either y or n.  If G1g is y, the value given in G1a must be the
      valid symbol of a gene already in Chado and this symbol must
      appear in the list in G1f.  If G1g is n, the value in G1a must
      not be the valid symbol of a gene already in Chado.

h)  If G31a contains the value y, G1g must also be y and G1a must
contain a symbol which is the valid symbol of a gene which is already
in Chado.  All other fields in this proforma, including the
non-renaming fields, must be blank.

i)  If G31b contains the value y, G1g must also be y and G1a must
contain a symbol which is the valid symbol of a gene which is already
in Chado.  All other fields in this proforma, including the
non-renaming fields, must be blank.


Notes for Haiyan and Peeves
===========================

A new FBgn will need to be allocated whenever G1f contains a list of
symbols, or whenever G1g contains the value n.  This rule presupposes
all the other validity conditions are met for the symbols which appear
in the proforma.

In the case of G1f containing no data and G1g having the value n, the
gene type (SO information) must be specified in G30.

Peeves will always generate a warning message whenever the data in
G31a or G31b is y.


Examples
========

1. Create a record for a completely new gene, with symbol NG1
-------------------------------------------------------------


! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :NG1
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :n
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

In the fullness of time, Harvard will allocate a new FBgn for this
gene.  The valid symbol for this gene will be NG1 and the data for
this gene will be set to that specified by the remainder of the
proforma.



2. Modify the data pertaining to an existing gene
-------------------------------------------------


! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :EG1
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :y
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

The existing gene with valid symbol EG1 will retain the same FBgn and
valid symbol (i.e., EG1) but its data will be modified in the manner
specified by the remainder of the proforma.



3. Rename an existing gene
--------------------------


! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :NG2
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :EG2
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :n
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

The existing gene with valid symbol EG2 will retain the same FBgn but
its valid symbol will become NG2.  EG2 will become an invalid symbol
for this gene and its data will be modified in the manner specified by
the remainder of the proforma.



4. Merge existing genes into an existing gene
---------------------------------------------

! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :MG1
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :MG1
MG2
MG3
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :y
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

All the data for each of the genes specified in G1f, which must be
valid symbols of gene present in Chado, will be merged into one gene
record which will be given the name MG1.  A new FBgn will be allocated
by Harvard and associated with the gene record just created.  The FBgn
previously associated with MG1, MG2 and MG3 will become invalid
uniquenames for the new gene record.  The symbols MG2 and MG3 will
become invalid symbols for the new gene record.



5. Merge existing genes into one record, giving the result a new symbol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :NG3
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :MG4
MG5
MG6
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :n
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

The data pertaining to the existing genes MG4, MG5 and MG6 will be
merged together.  The resulting gene will be given a new symbol NG3
and Harvard will allocate it an FBgn in the fullness of time.  MG4,
MG5 and MG6 will all become invalid symbols for NG3.  The FBgn
previously associated with MG4, MG5 and MG6 will all become invalid
uniquenames for the new gene record.



6. Delete all data pertaining to a gene
---------------------------------------

! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :EG3
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :y
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :y
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :

All data pertaining to the existing gene with valid symbol EG3,
including its symbol, its FBgn and any relationships with any other
object, will be deleted from Chado.



7. Dissociate a gene from a publication
---------------------------------------

! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in database                      *a :EG4
! G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :
! G1f.  Action - merge genes                                   :
! G1g.  Is G1a the valid symbol of a gene in FlyBase?          :y
! G31a. Action - delete gene              - TAKE CARE :
! G31b. Action - dissociate G1a from FBrf - TAKE CARE :y

The curation record in which this proforma appears must specify a
valid FBrf in P22.  All data for the gene with valid symbol EG4 which
is attributed to that specific FBrf (and only that data which is so
attributed) will be deleted from Chado.



Invalid proformae
-----------------

Other than the 7 forms given above, all other forms of the data for
these six proforma field must generate an error condition and must not
initiate any changes in the contents of Chado.
