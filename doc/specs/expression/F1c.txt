## ! F1c. Action - merge these products(s) (symbols or FB#s) :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (separated by returns)
Implemented (in validate_merge_using_ids)


### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_merge_using_ids)

### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented (in validate_merge_using_ids)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if MA1g is filled in

  * checks in validate_merge_using_ids:
    * if field contains data, each entry in list must be separated by returns
    * there must be at least two entries (i.e. FBid numbers) in the list
    * there must not be any duplications in the list (checked using check_for_duplicated_lines subroutine)

    * if an entry matches the expected format (i.e. (FBtr|FBpp)[0-9]{7}) it checks that it is valid in Chado and warns if not,
    * otherwise, if it matches the general format of an FBid, warns that it is not the type of FBid expected for that field,
    * otherwise, if it matches the valid *symbol* of the FBid type expected (i.e. someone entered an insertion symbol instead of an id by mistake), warns that a symbol has been entered, and provides the valid FBlc number for that symbol, so that it can easily be entered instead,
    * otherwise, warns that it is not a valid FBid format.


Cross-checks with other fields:

    * sub 'plingc_merge_check' - no !c in entire proforma if F1c is filled in

    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  F1b and F1c must not both contain data

    * subroutine 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details of what this subroutine does.

The following check is done at the end of proforma checking within expression.pl, rather than trying to add it to the 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' subroutine which is used for several different 'Harvard' style proformae:


* If gene products are being merged:

  * checks that the FBids in F1c (merge field) are all of one type (i.e. FBtr or FBpp) and prints an error message if not.
  * checks that the format of the new valid symbol in F1a matches the type of the FBids (in F1c) which are being merged.
