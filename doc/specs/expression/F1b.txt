## ! F1b. Action - rename this gene product (symbol)      :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented - in validate_rename)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented - in validate_rename)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented - in validate_rename)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented - in validate_rename)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Cross-checks within field

  * the data must either be empty or be a single valid symbol of a gene product (i.e. FBtr or FBpp) which exists in Chado. (in validate_rename)

  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if F1b is filled in


Cross-checks with other fields

    * symbol in F1b cannot be the same as in F1a (in validate_rename and cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields)
    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  F1b and F1c must not both contain data

    * subroutine 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details of what this subroutine does.

The following check is done at the end of proforma checking within expression.pl, rather than trying to add it to the 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' subroutine which is used for several different 'Harvard' style proformae:

* If the gene product is being renamed, checks that the format of the new valid symbol in F1a matches the type of FBid in F1f (i.e. either genesymbol-XR or allelesymbolRA for a FBtr id, either genesymbol-XP or allelesymbolPA for a FBpp id).
