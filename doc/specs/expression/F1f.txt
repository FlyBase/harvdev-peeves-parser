## ! F1f. Database id (default 'new')   :

### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field)


### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field)

### Inclusion essential:

Yes (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

Yes
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field - checks both for whether the entire field is empty, and also whether individual values in a hashed list are empty)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

in 'validate_primary_FBid_field':

* each entry must either be the string 'new' or an FBid number of the types expected for the proforma (ie. FBpp or FBtr)

* if the entry is an FBid (ie. FBpp or FBtr) number, it must be valid in chado.



Cross-checks with other fields:

in 'validate_primary_FBid_field':

* The number of entries in the list in F1f must match the number of entries in the F1a field


Cross-checks done after parsing the entire proforma:

sub 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details.

The following check is done at the end of proforma checking within expression.pl, rather than trying to add it to the 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' subroutine which is used for several different 'Harvard' style proformae:

* If the gene product is being renamed, checks that the format of the new valid symbol in F1a matches the type of FBid in F1f (i.e. either genesymbol-XR or allelesymbolRA for a FBtr id, either genesymbol-XP or allelesymbolPA for a FBpp id).
