## ! AB1h. FlyBase genotype variant ID (FBba) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (using 'single_line' subroutine in validate_AB1h)

### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_AB1h)

### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

The following is implemented (in validate_AB1h):
Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
which is almost certainly wrong as users can't currently submit info for balancers (!)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Within validate_AB1h:

* 'FBid_list_check' subroutine checks basic format of value given i.e. it must be an FBid of the expected type (i.e FBba[0-9]{7}) (note that this subroutine allows the value 'new' in addition to FBid format, so an additional check is also performed in 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' to prevent 'new' in this field - not worked out the details yet)

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' checks that the value in AB1h must exist in Chado as a valid FBid (uniquename) (there is no check for correct 'type' of uniquename here, that is done in the basic 'FBid_list_check' format check described above).

* If this field is filled in in a non-user record, issue a warning as curators don't normally fill this field in.

Cross-checks with other fields:

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' subroutine does a lot of field cross-checking and validity checks of field values - see the gene/G1h.txt specs file for details.
