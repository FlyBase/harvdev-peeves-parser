### Status:

doc: checked that doc reflects what has been implemented

Not yet implemented:

* similar to G2c, there is no check that the value given in AB2c is really a valid fullname in chado.

* there is no cross-check of AB2a with AB2c - need to add something that takes into account whether or not the allele is new (AB1g) and whether or not rename/merge fields (AB1e/AB1f) are filled in. [gm131211]
