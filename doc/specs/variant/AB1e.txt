  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if AB1e is filled in


Cross-checks with other fields

  * symbol in AB1e cannot be the same as in AB1a (in validate_rename)


  * checks done after parsing entire proforma

    * 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' (check when x1h filled in)

    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  AB1e and AB1f must not both contain data


  * sub 'cross_check_x1e_x1g' checks that if AB1e is filled in, AB1g is 'n'

### Comments:

'validate_rename' subroutine still uses dehash despite presence of 'no_hashes_in_proforma' in basic field checks, but left for now and may well be advantageous/necessary to keep it, for same reasons as given in G1e.txt


### Status:

doc: checked that doc reflects what has been implemented
