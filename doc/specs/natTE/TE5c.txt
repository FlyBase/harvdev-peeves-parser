## ! TE5c. Number of copies in reported genome (dupl for multiple)  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): TE5c -> TE5d


### Checks:

Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90j is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

 * sub 'validate_approximate_number' checks that the value is either a positive integer (sub check_positive_integer) or is of the format:

Approximately n.

where 'n' is a positive integer (sub check_positive_integer).

Checks between fields:

 * TE5c must be filled in if TE5d is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
