### Status:

Not implemented any checks - just validate_stub subroutine, for the reasons below.

Not clear whether this is still supposed to be curated into.

Following sql adapted from field mapping table gives no rows:

select fo.name, pub.uniquename from feature fo, feature f, feature_relationship fr, cvterm cvt, feature_relationship_pub frp, pub where fo.feature_id=fr.object_id and f.feature_id=fr.subject_id and fr.type_id=cvt.cvterm_id and frp.feature_relationship_id=fr.feature_relationship_id and pub.pub_id=frp.pub_id and cvt.name='isolate_of' and f.is_obsolete='f';

Need to figure out whether we should still have this field, and where the data live in the db if we are supposed to keep curating it.
