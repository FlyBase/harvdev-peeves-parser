Checks between fields:

- An error message is printed if the same organism is present more than once in the same curation record (i.e. when more than one proforma have the same value in both SP1a and SP1b).

Checks between fields:

- If SP1g = 'n', the combination of 'SP1a' (organism.genus) plus 'SP1b' (organism.species) (i.e. the unique key in organism) must NOT already be in chado

- If SP1g = 'y', the combination of 'SP1a' (organism.genus) plus 'SP1b' (organism.species) (i.e. the unique key in organism) MUST already be in chado
