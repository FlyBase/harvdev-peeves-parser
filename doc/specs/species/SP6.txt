     - warns if there isn't already data in chado (prints a warning both when SP6 is filled in and when it is empty)

   - if data is being added in SP6 (ie. no !c) and there is already data in chado
     - warns if the data in SP6 is not identical to what is already in chado (suggests that perhaps the curator was trying to change existing data)
