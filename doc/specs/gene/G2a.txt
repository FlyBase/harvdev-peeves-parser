## ! G2a.  Action - gene name to use in FlyBase                *e :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (i.e. it does not always have to be filled in), but see 'Cross-checks with other fields' below for what happens when other renaming/merging fields are filled in.

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


Checks within field

  * checks done in validate_new_full_name

    * sub 'check_allowed_characters' makes sure the symbol only contains characters from an allowed set (see %mapping_table at the top of check_allowed_characters in tools.pl for current list of allowed characters)

    * check that any greek symbols are not malformed

Cross-checks with other fields

  * checks done after parsing entire proforma

    * If G2c is filled in, G2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

    * If G2c and G2a are both filled in, they must not be the same value  (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'not same')


    * for gene renames (i.e. G1e contains data): 
       * print an error message if G2a is filled in without G2c being filled in (for those genes that have a fullname in chado).

       * if neither G2a nor G2c are filled in:

          * if the gene in G1e has a fullname in chado, print an error message that this is only allowed 'if you are trying to rename a gene's symbol without changing the full name'

          * if the gene in G1e does not have a fullname in chado, print an error message reminding the curator to fill in G2a if they want to name the gene.

    * for gene merges (ie. G1f contains data): 
       * G2c must NOT be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')
       * G2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')



    * for existing genes:

      * print a warning if G2a is filled in:  "You have filled in G2a. for an existing gene '<symbol>', did you mean to put it in G2b."
