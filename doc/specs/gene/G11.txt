## ! G11.  Cytological map position - comments [SoftCV]       *D :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (separated by returns)
**Not implemented ??- See Status below

### !c Applicable:

Yes
Implemented (in validate_G11)

### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented (in validate_G11)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Depends on value in field.

The one SoftCV prefix is: "Location inferred from insertion in:" 

If this SoftCV prefix is used then that which follows the : must be a valid FBal allele
symbol, either previously curated and valid or instantiated in the curation record.

Note: there's a complication for "Location inferred from insertion in:" - a curator can
put the location in as follows if it clarifies multiple cytologies in G10

e.g.

Location 66B1--66B5 inferred from insertion in: pbl[09645]
Location 66A20--66A22 inferred from insertion in: pbl[EP3415]

this is OK, its just that Peeves will have to search for the string:
"^Location (.+? )?inferred from insertion in: "
where the (.+? ) thing is optional (hence the ? after the () ) and if
it is there then it should match cytological format, i.e. the same
checking as done on cytology in the G10 fields.

If the softCV prefix is not used, this is a free text statement and the only check is that
things flanked by @@ are either existing valid symbols of any FBid type or instantiated in
the curation record.

### Status:

doc: not yet finished checking whether what is written in Checks has been implemented

Not yet implemented

* I don't think that this will cope with multiple values, but need a test record to check
