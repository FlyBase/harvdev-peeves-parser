## G24a, G24b and G24c evidence codes and data specifications.

In what follows, a GO:ID is defined as the characters GO: followed by seven decimal digits.  To be valid data for the G24 fields, a GO:ID must occur in the Id:  field of a valid term from gene_ontology.obo.

--------------------------------------------------------
### IC - inferred by curator

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' from ' followed by at least one GO:ID in format
GO:0000000

Muliple GO:IDs should be separated by pipes.

e.g. IC from GO:1234567|GO:7654321

Unless the publication is an internal reference (i.e. *T = FlyBase analysis)...

   Each GO:ID(s) following the ' from ' should also appear again (at least once more) in any of G24[abc] lines within the same gene record of the same report in front of an experimental evidence code. The experimental evidence codes are currently IDA, IEP, IPI, IGI, IMP.

e.g. gene record with lines:

*d some GO process ; GO:1234567 | IMP
*d some other GO process ; GO:7654321 | IC from GO:1234567
would be valid because GO:1234567 has been assigned with IMP in another line.

BUT

*d some GO process ; GO:1234567 | NAS
*d some other GO process ; GO:7654321 | IC from GO:1234567
wouldn't be ok because NAS is not an experimental evidence code 

BUT

*d some GO process ; GO:1234567 | IMP
*d some other GO process ; GO:7654321 | IC from GO:4545454
also not ok because GO:4545454 does not appear in the the gene record.	

Both types of error could be reported with the same error report along the lines of:

Incorrect use of IC; 'GO:1234567' must be assigned to the gene with experimental evidence.


--------------------------------------------------------
IGC - inferred from genomic context

OPTIONALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;
multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated
by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated
by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

--------------------------------------------------
ISS - inferred from sequence or structural similarity

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;
multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated
by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated
by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID

Note, technically GO allows exceptions without 'with' for ISS, but as it is an exception to
the normal rule, Peeves is set to make with mandatory for ISS.

If no ' with ' and database identifier is entered error report is:

Must have 'with ' data after the 'ISS' evidence code in '<whole GO line minus provenance>'
(if you cannot provide a database identifier, consider using the ISM evidence code instead).


Specification for checks of database identifier after the 'with ':

Note the following equally applies to ISA, ISM and ISO. I am not sure to what extent these
checks are implemented...?

(gm130129 - check of the databases after the with is implemented in the same way for all evidence codes - using the check_go_databases subroutine, so the comments I've made below about what is/is not implemented applies to ALL evidence codes that have been specified as MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ')

e.g.    ISS with FLYBASE:scb; FB:FBgn0003328
        ISS with FLYBASE:Brd; FB:FBgn0000216, FLYBASE:m4; FB:FBgn0002629, FLYBASE:Tom; FB:FBgn0026320
        ISS with HUGO:ARF1; OMIM:103180

1. If the database identifiers are internal (ie FLYBASE: or FB:)...
   For each pair of identifiers...

a.   Check that both symbol and FBgn IDs have been included (in format FLYBASE:<valid gene
   symbol>; FB:<corresponding valid FBgn>)

   Check that symbol and FBgn refer to the same gene.
   Check that symbol is a currently valid symbol.

(gm&st130129 - a. above is implemented, except that Greek symbols are not dealt with properly - valid symbols with a &bgr;-style Greeks are reported as false positive errors).

b.   If possible, check that the gene after the ' with ' also appears in the database with
   the same GO:ID/GO:term assigned by experimental evidence.

   i.e.

   *d Notch signaling pathway ; GO:0007219 | ISS with FLYBASE:Brd; FB:FBgn0000216,
    FLYBASE:m4; FB:FBgn0002629, FLYBASE:m6; FB:FBgn0002632

   is valid only if

   *d Notch signaling pathway ; GO:0007219 | [IEP|IDA|IPI|IMP|IGI] appears in any other
    gene record for FLYBASE:Brd AND FLYBASE:m4 AND FLYBASE:m6

   Now I would check this in genes_go (I guess I should also look in unparsed records)
   where I find:

   *a Brd
   *E FBrf0123097 == rf021015.e == gm7396.h == Lai et al., 2000, Development 127(2): 291--306
   *d Notch signaling pathway ; GO:0007219 | inferred from mutant phenotype

   *a m4
   *E FBrf0123097 == rf021015.e == gm7396.h == Lai et al., 2000, Development 127(2): 291--306
   *d Notch signaling pathway ; GO:0007219 | inferred from mutant phenotype

   *a m6
   *E FBrf0131793 == rf020715.e == Swiss-Prot Project Members, 2000.10.1, UniProt: O97179
   *H No GO data. rf020715

   Brd and m4 are assigned to GO:0007219 by IMP but m6 isn't so m6 is not valid for ISS.
   Report error:

   Invalid use of ISS; GO:0007219 is not assigned to FLYBASE:m6 with experimental evidence
   (In this case it isn't assigned to GO:0007219 at all!)

(gm130129 - ** b. above is NOT implemented**).

2. If the database identifiers are external to FlyBase...

   For other databases it is not practical to enforce the requirement for both symbol and
   geneID. Sometimes the identifer will not be for a gene and there may only be a single
   appropriate ID.

a.   However we can check that the database identifier is valid...

   The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.  The
   database_abbreviation must be identical to one those contained in an abbreviation line
   within http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.xrf_abbs

   e.g. 
   *f plasma membrane ; GO:0005886 | ISS with MGD:Gpm6a; MGI:MGI:107671
   is ok because following appear in the abbreviation fields of
   http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.xrf_abbs file
   abbreviation: MGD
   abbreviation: MGI

(gm&st130129 - a. above is implemented)

b.   What follows the colon is harder to check. In theory there should be enough info in the
   http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.xrf_abbs file to make rules but in info in that file
   is not always correct. For example the mouse case above, seems to be out of date as the
   example URL provided for MGI is invalid. Clearly, it would be good to get this updated
   and improve out checks in future but it is too much work to get chase all these dbs for
   current info at present. I think it is also beyond our scope at present to check the
   specified object exists in the external database.

(gm130129 - ** b. above is NOT implemented**)

--------------------------------------------------
ISM - inferred from sequence model

OPTIONALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;

(if you cannot provide a database identifier, consider using the ISM evidence code instead).

--------------------------------------------------
ISO - inferred from sequence orthology

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;
multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. EXP must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '

ADDITIONAL INFO FOR EXP: EXP must only be assigned by external data sources; i.e. provenance must not be FlyBase. If code is EXP AND provenance is FlyBase then report error:

Incorrect use of EXP; add provenance flag or use an alternative experimental evidence code.

--------------------------------------------------

IPI - inferred from physical interaction

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;
multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated
by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated
by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

If the database identifiers are internal (ie FLYBASE: or FB:)...
   For each pair of identifiers...

      Check that both symbol and FBgn IDs have been included (in format FLYBASE:<valid
      gene symbol>; FB:<corresponding valid FBgn>)

      Check that symbol and FBgn refer to the same gene
      Check that symbol is valid symbol and not a synonym

multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated
by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated
by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

Note that ' with ' isn't mandatory for IGI according GO but all exisiting FlyBase IGI
annotations (838 in current ga_file) use ' with ' and we agreed this is a good check to
have.

If the database identifiers are internal (ie FLYBASE: or FB:)...
   For each pair of identifiers...

      Check that both symbol and FBgn IDs have been included (in format FLYBASE:<valid
      gene symbol>; FB:<corresponding valid FBgn>)

      Check that symbol and FBgn refer to the same gene
      Check that symbol is valid symbol and not a synonym

Check format of the database identifier...

database_abbreviation must be identical to one those contained in an abbreviation line
within http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.xrf_abbs

Must have 'with ' data after the 'IGI' evidence code in '<whole GO line minus provenance>'


--------------------------------------------------
IEA - inferred from electronic annotation

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier;
multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object (usually a gene) are separated
by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated
by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

e.g.	IEA with FLYBASE:scb; FB:FBgn0003328
	IEA with InterPro:IPR000001

If the database identifiers are internal (ie FLYBASE: or FB:)...
   For each pair of identifiers...

      gene symbol>; FB:<corresponding valid FBgn>)

      Check that symbol and FBgn refer to the same gene
      Check that symbol is valid symbol and not a synonym

If the database identifiers are external to FlyBase...

   Check format of the database identifier...

   database_abbreviation must be identical to one those contained in an abbreviation line
   within http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.xrf_abbs

This code should usually not be used in manual curation, so if it is used, a warning message is issued, as follows:

The 'IEA' evidence code should not be used in regular literature curation, did you put the wrong evidence in '<whole GO line minus provenance>' ?

--------------------------------------------------
ND - no biological data available

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. ND must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '

ADDITIONAL INFO FOR ND: ND must only be assigned based on FBrf0159398
i.e. if *U is not FBrf0159398 then report error
Incorrect use of ND; ND must only be assigned from the internal GO reference FBrf0159398
--------------------------------------------------
RCA - inferred from reviewed computational analysis

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. RCA must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '
--------------------------------------------------
NAS - non-traceable author statement

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. NAS must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '
--------------------------------------------------
TAS - traceable author statement

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. TAS must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '
--------------------------------------------------
IMP - inferred from mutant phenotype

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. IMP must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '
--------------------------------------------------
IDA - inferred from direct assay

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value

--------------------------------------------------
IEP - inferred from expression pattern

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. IEP must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '
IEP - inferred from expression pattern

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE:no value
i.e. IEP must not be used with ' with ' or ' from '

IEP should only be used in GO annotation with biological process (G24c line), so a check has also been added to warn if it is used in G24a or G24b.

The warning lines issued are:

G24a: Invalid use of IEP evidence code in '<whole GO line - provenance>'
IEP can only be used with biological process terms. If the location of a gene product has been determined you should use IDA.

G24b: Invalid use of IEP evidence code  '<whole GO line - provenance>'
IEP can only be used with biological process terms. Molecular function cannot be inferred directly from where a gene product is expressed.

--------------------------------------------------



IKR - inferred from key residues

MANDATORIALLY HAS NOT QUALIFIER BEFORE GO TERM: IKR can only used to make negated annotations so the qualify NOT must be present. If NOT is absent Peeves should warn that the IKR evidence code qualifier cannot be used without the NOT qualifier.

OPTIONALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier; multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object are separated by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

--------------------------------------------------

IBA - inferred from biological ancestor

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier; multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object are separated by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

ADDITIONAL INFO FOR IBA: IBA should not used in regular literature curation so a warning is also included to that effect, this warning is not seen by the GO curator (as the GO curator does add G annotations with this evidence code).

--------------------------------------------------

IBD - inferred from biological descendant

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier; multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object are separated by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

ADDITIONAL INFO FOR IBD: IBD should not used in regular literature curation so a warning is also included to that effect, this warning is not seen by the GO curator (as the GO curator does add G annotations with this evidence code).

--------------------------------------------------
IRD - inferred from rapid divergence

MANDATORIALLY HAS NOT QUALIFIER BEFORE GO TERM: IRD can only used to make negated annotations so the qualify NOT must be present. If NOT is absent Peeves should warn that the IRD evidence code qualifier cannot be used without the NOT qualifier.

MANDATORIALLY HAS VALUE AFTER CODE: ' with ' followed by at least one database identifier; multiple database identifiers that refer to the same object are separated by semicolons; multiple database identifiers that refer to different object are separated by commas. The general format of the identifier is database_abbreviation:uniqueID.

ADDITIONAL INFO FOR IRD: IRD should not used in regular literature curation so a warning is also included to that effect, this warning is not seen by the GO curator (as the GO curator does add G annotations with this evidence code).

### Status

### Updated:

gm131204 - evidence code doc in G24table.mkdn replaced with corresponding text from gene.checks.pro (as that was more up-to-date), and file renamed to G24_evidence_codes.txt
