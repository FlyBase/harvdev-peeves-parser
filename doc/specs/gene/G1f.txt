## ! G1f.  Action - merge these genes (symbols)                   :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (separated by returns)
Implemented (in validate_x1f)


### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_x1f)

### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented (in validate_x1f)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:



Checks within field

  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if G1e is filled in

  * checks in validate_x1f:
    * if field contains data, each entry in list must be separated by returns
    * each entry in list must be a valid gene symbol in Chado
    * there must be at least two entries (i.e. gene symbols) in the list
    * there must not be any duplications in the list (checked using check_for_duplicated_lines subroutine)

Cross-checks with other fields

  * checks done after parsing entire proforma

    * 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' (check when x1h filled in)

    * If G1f is filled in, G2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

    * If G1f is filled in, G2c must NOT be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')

    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  G1e and G1f must not both contain data

    * sub 'plingc_merge_check' - no !c in proforma if G1f is filled in


    * If G32 field is present in the proforma, G1f field must be present in proforma (to make sure that the following check is definitely carried out I guess ?)

    * If G32 is filled in (checking first that it has a single value so that the cross-checking code works), the same value must not be in G1f



    * if G1f is filled in:

       * warns if there is no 'Source for merge line: ' at all in G28b

       * warns if the string after 'Source for ' is not merge e.g. if 'Source for identity of: ' was written in error instead

    * if G28b is filled in:

       * for 'Source for merge':

          * warns if G1f is empty

          * if G1f contains data, warns if the genes listed in G28b 'Source for merge line: ' do not match those listed in the G1f line (they do not have to be in the same order)

### Comments:

'validate_x1f' subroutine still uses dehash, despite the fact that 'no_hashes_in_proforma' has been added to the basic field checks (before validate_G1e is called).  The dehash is necessary for later cross-checks in the gene proforma (cross-checking G1f data with other fields (G32)), so this should be left in the validate_x1f subroutine.
