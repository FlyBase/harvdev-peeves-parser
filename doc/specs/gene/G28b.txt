### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (in validate_G28b) (see comment below)

### !c Applicable:

Yes
Implemented (in validate_G28b)


### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented (in validate_G28b)

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


Checks in validate_G28b

* if the list of genes contains a @ an error is printed (and none of the other checks are done)

* Checks that each line begins with a SoftCV of either "Source for merge of: " or "Source for identity of: ".  Two different error messages can be produced:
  * Warning if missed the space after the : but the SoftCV is otherwise fine
  * Warning if the beginning of line does not match either SoftCV at all

* Checks that there is more than one symbol after the SoftCV prefix

* For 'Source for identity of: ', checks that there are two symbols after the SoftCV prefix


Checks done after whole proforma read (cross checks with other fields): 

* if G28b is filled in:

  * warns if there are any duplicated symbols in a line (uses check_for_duplicated_lines to check)

  * for 'Source for identity':

     * warns if the symbol in G1a does not appear in the list in G28b

     * warns if G1e is empty

     * if G1e contains data, warns if the symbol in G1e does not appear in the list in G28b


   * for 'Source for merge':

      * warns if G1f is empty

      * if G1f contains data, warns if the genes listed in G28b 'Source for merge line: ' do not match those listed in the G1f line (they do not have to be in the same order)



* if G1e is filled in:

   * warns if there is no 'Source for identity line: ' at all in G28b

   * warns if the string after 'Source for ' is not identity e.g. if 'Source for merge of: ' was written in error instead


* if G1f is filled in:

   * warns if there is no 'Source for merge line: ' at all in G28b

   * warns if the string after 'Source for ' is not merge e.g. if 'Source for identity of: ' was written in error instead

### Comments:

Status of Multiple values allowed check:
 * a warning is printed if more than one line is put in the G28b field.  NOTE that checks within validate_G28b are still carried out in this situation, but the cross-checks with other fields are not carried out (have not been able to figure out why, [gm131216]).
