Formatting checks within field:


These are the checks that should be implemented:Note: This applies to Dmel only.
When there is any value in this filled it will minimally be one of 
1-
2-
3-
4-
[I need to be able to do reg expressions for the next bit - I can't, so
I made it up and gave examples]
characters immediately following the - will be '(n1-9).(n1-9)' (which may be followed by a -- for range then another '(n1-9).(n1-9)')
e.g.
*b 2-50.1
*b 3-89--90
May include L and R - check for other letter usage before doing anything

@@@ pcl The format is fairly easy.  We need to add Y- to the list of permissible prefices.
Each component in a range is then a floating point number x in the range 0<=x<67 for 1-,
0<=x<108 for 2-, -1<=x<104 for 3- and may only be 0 for 4-.  Further information can be
found at http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/maps/lk/cytotable.txt or its up to date
equivalent.  The L/R proviso is trickier, and needs further work to specify what's really
permissible. @@@

NOTE: may be able to use code currently in validate_G7ab to help with the regular expression [gm131213]

Checks between fields:

* If G6 is filled in, G5 must only contain a single value.
