## ! G1h. FlyBase gene ID (FBgn) *z :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.
Implemented (using 'single_line' subroutine in validate_G1h)

### !c Applicable:

No.
Implemented

### Inclusion essential:

Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
Not Implemented (if we really want the rule above)

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
Implemented (in validate_G1h)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Within validate_G1h:

* 'FBid_list_check' subroutine checks basic format of value given i.e. it must be an FBid of the expected type (i.e FBgn[0-9]{7}) (note that this subroutine allows the value 'new' in addition to FBid format, so an additional check is also performed in 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' to prevent 'new' in this field - not worked out the details yet)

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' checks that the value in G1h must exist in Chado as a valid FBid (uniquename) (there is no check for correct 'type' of uniquename here, that is done in the basic 'FBid_list_check' format check described above).


* If this field is filled in in a non-user record, issue a warning as curators don't normally fill this field in.

Cross-checks with other fields:

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' subroutine does a lot of field cross-checking and validity checks of field values, but have not worked out the details yet, but the checking does include:

   * the FBid of the symbol in G1a must match the FBid given in G1h.
   * G1h must not be filled in or even be present in the proforma if G1e (rename field) is filled in.
   * G1h must not be filled in or even be present in the proforma if G1f (merge field) is filled in.
