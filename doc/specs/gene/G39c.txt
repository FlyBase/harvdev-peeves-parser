## ! G39c. Gene summary - Date stamp (y, n, or YYYYMDD) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (implemented) (Note, is implemented in both basic process_field_data line and also in validate_G24f line, so could get two messages for same error at the moment but hard to implement all checks otherwise).

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)

### Checks:

within validate_G24f:

* if the field is empty, a warning is issed, saying:

          "Default value of 'y' removed from gene summary date field!  " .
	       "Any gene summary data will be recorded with new date. "

* If the field is filled in with anything other than 'y' or 'n'

    * the value is checked to see if it is a valid date not later than the current date, using the 'bad_iso_date' subroutine

    * if the curator is not a GO curator, a warning is printed "WARNING: Non-gene summary curators don't usually put anything other than 'y' or 'n' in this field, did you mean to put xxxxxx" [figured printing this message for non-GO curators would be OK as likely to be GO curator submitting proforma.]


Checks between fields:

Must be filled in if G39a. is filled in.

Must be filled in if G39b. is filled in with 'n'
