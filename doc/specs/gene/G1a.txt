## ! G1a.  Gene symbol to use in FlyBase                       *a :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.
Implemented ('single_line' subroutine in loop where the field is identified)

### !c Applicable:

No.
Implemented (in validate_primary_proforma_field)

### Inclusion essential:

Yes.
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes.
Implemented ('contains_data' subroutine in loop where the field is identified)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


Checks within field:

  *  sub validate_primary_proforma_field (see doc/specs/allele/GA1a.txt for details)


Checks between fields:

  * sub 'cross_check_1a_1g' checks the following:

     * If the value given in G1g is 'y', the value given in G1a must be held in Chado as a current valid symbol of type FBgn.

     * If the value given in G1g is 'n', the value given in G1a must not be held in Chado as a current valid symbol of type FBgn.

### Comments:

Paul had written out the character set in BNF, and it seemed a shame to remove it, so I have put it here.  I am not sure whether it is actually correct mind, particularly the information about <superscript> and <subscript>

To be valid, the value must be a <qualified-symbol> as defined by
the following BNF, where the term <species-prefix> is defined
informally as any one synonym of type 'EXACT FBabbreviation' appearing
in fly_taxonomy.obo with the sole exception of the synonym Dmel.

_(Informally: a symbol may only contain letters of either case,
digits, characters from the following set: . : - ( )' and Greek
symbols.  Superscripts, enclosed in [ ] brackets, and subscripts,
enclosed in [[ ]] brackets, are allowed in gene symbols.  If
G1a is for a species other than Dmel then the species prefix
must be valid in_ fly_taxonomy.obo _.)_

-------------------------

<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

<roman-letter> ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z

<greek-letter> ::= a | b | g | d | e | z | ee | th | i | k | l | m | n | x | o | p | r | s | t | u | ph | kh | ps | oh | A | B | G | D | E | Z | EE | TH | I | K | L | M | N | X | O | P | R | S | T | U | PH | KH | PS | OH

<greek-entity> ::= &<greek-letter>gr;

<alphanumeric> ::= <roman-letter> | <greek-entity> | <digit>

<punctuation> ::= . | : | - | '

<word> ::= <alphanumeric> | <word><alphanumeric> | <word><punctuation>

<term> ::= <word> | <word>(<word>)

<superscript> ::= [<symbol>]

<subscript> ::= [[<symbol>]]

<symbol> ::= <term> | <symbol><superscript> | <symbol><subscript>

<qualified-symbol> ::= <symbol> | <species-prefix>\\<symbol>

-------------------------


There are further constraints on valid gene symbols, for tags and
fusion genes for instance, which are not captured by the BNF given
above.  Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to give them a formal
definition as they depend on vagaries of the history of genetic
nomenclature.  In consequence, Peeves will necessarily produce both
false positives and false negatives.  In practice, these have proved
to be relatively rare occurrences.
