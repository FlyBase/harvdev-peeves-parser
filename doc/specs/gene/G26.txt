## ! G26.  Foreign gene/Tag summary information                  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No

### !c Applicable:

Yes

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

The basic format of the line, according to curation_manual, is

*u Foreign sequence; species == <>; gene|epitope tag|function tag|sequence tag == <gene symbol>; <accession number>.

where "; <accession number>" is optional.

So the line should match this regexp:

^Foreign sequence\; species \=\= (.+?)\; (gene|epitope tag|function tag|sequence tag) \=\= (.+?)(\; .+?)?\.$

The value given in $1, i.e. the species, must match the species abbreviation of the gene symbol in G1a.

* For new non-drosophilid genes, warns if G26 is not filled in.


Cross-checks with other fields

* If G26 is filled in and includes an accession number, that accession number must be present in G35.

* If G35 is filled in, G26 must be filled in and the accession number in G35 must match the accession number part of the G26 line.  

* If G26 is filled in, warns if the FBrf is not FBrf0199194.

### Comments:

It may be possible to put constraints on <gene symbol> in the future but for the time being no checks need to be made.
