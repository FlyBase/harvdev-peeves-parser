## ! G26.  Foreign gene/Tag summary information                  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No

### !c Applicable:

Yes

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

The basic format of the line, according to curation_manual, is

*u Foreign sequence; species == <>; gene|epitope tag|function tag|sequence tag == <gene symbol>; <accession number>.

where "; <accession number>" is optional.

So the line should match this regexp:

^Foreign sequence\; species \=\= (.+?)\; (gene|epitope tag|function tag|sequence tag) \=\= (.+?)(\; .+?)?\.$

The value given in $1, i.e. the species, must match the species abbreviation of the gene symbol in G1a.

### Comments:

It may be possible to put constraints on <gene symbol> in the future but for the time being no checks need to be made.

### Status:



### Updated:

gm131204 (doc for this field moved here from gene.checks.pro).
gm151001 (added Dupl. for multiple field info).
gm160717 (check of species part changed to 'the species, must match the species abbreviation of the gene symbol in G1a.')
