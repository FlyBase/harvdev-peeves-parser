## ! G24f. GO - Date stamp (y, n, or YYYYMMDD)                    :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.
Implemented (in validate_G24f, using 'single_line' subroutine)

### !c Applicable:

Yes
Implemented


### Inclusion essential:

No (unless other G24 fields are filled in in that proforma, in which case it temporarily becomes essential for that particular proforma)
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No.
Implemented
??check with Susan T. - see Q below??

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

within validate_G24f:

* if the field is empty, a warning is issed, saying:

          "Default value of 'y' removed from GO date field!  " .
	       "Any GO data will be recorded with new date. "
??Q to Susan T.: is the above check correct

* If the field is filled in with anything other than 'y' or 'n'

    * the value is checked to see if it is a valid date not later than the current date, using the 'bad_iso_date' subroutine

    * if the curator is not a GO curator, a warning is printed "WARNING: Non-GO curators don't usually put anything other than 'y' or 'n' in this field, did you mean to put xxxxxx"

### Status:

Updated doc to reflect what has been implemented.

Check with Susan T. the following !c rules which were in the markdown version of the doc. Note that they are not implemented yet:

If !c is used:

* G1a must contain a valid value and G1g must contain 'y'
* the value given in G24f must be different from the value stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a.

If !c is not used:

* if G1a contains a valid value and G1g contains 'y', either:
    * the value given in G24f must be identical to the value stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a or
    * G24f must contain a valid value and no value is stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a;
* if G1a does not contain a valid value or G1g does not contain 'y', either:
    * G24f must be empty or
    * G24f must contain a valid value .
