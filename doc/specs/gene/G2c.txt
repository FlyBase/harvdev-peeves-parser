## ! G2c.  Action - replace this/these gene name(s)               :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (i.e. it does not always have to be filled in), but see 'Cross-checks with other fields' below for what happens when other renaming/merging fields are filled in.

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


Cross-checks with other fields

  * checks done after parsing entire proforma


    * sub cross_check_full_name_rename checks that the value in G2c matches the fullname in chado of the subject of the proforma ie. the symbol in the symbol rename field (if both the symbol and fullname are being renamed) or the symbol in the primary symbol field (if only the fullname is being renamed).

    * If G2c is filled in, G2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

    * If G2c and G2a are both filled in, they must not be the same value  (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'not same')


    * for gene renames (i.e. G1e contains data): 
       * print an error message if G2a is filled in without G2c being filled in (for those genes that have a fullname in chado).

       * if neither G2a nor G2c are filled in:

          * if the gene in G1e has a fullname in chado, print an error message that this is only allowed 'if you are trying to rename a gene's symbol without changing the full name'

          * if the gene in G1e does not have a fullname in chado, print an error message reminding the curator to fill in G2a if they want to name the gene.

    * for gene merges (ie. G1f contains data): 

       * G2c must NOT be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')
       * G2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')
