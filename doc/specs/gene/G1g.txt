## ! G1g.  Is G1a the current symbol of a gene in FlyBase?        :

### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (this will get caught by the call to 'check_y_or_n' in 'cross_check_1a_1g'

### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_x1g)

### Inclusion essential:

Yes
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes
Implemented (in validate_x1g)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


  * sub 'cross_check_1a_1g' checks the following:

     * If the value given in G1g is 'y', the value given in G1a must be held in Chado as a current valid symbol of type FBgn.

     * If the value given in G1g is 'n', the value given in G1a must not be held in Chado as a current valid symbol of type FBgn.

     * it also checks that the value in G1g is either 'y' or 'n' by calling 'check_y_or_n'

Other cross-checks with other fields:


  * If neither G1f or G1e are filled in, and G2c is empty, then G2a may only be filled in when G1g is 'n', otherwise it prints the warning "You have filled in G2a. for an existing gene '<symbol>', did you mean to put it in G2b."

  * sub 'cross_check_x1e_x1g' checks that if G1e is filled in, G1g is 'n'
