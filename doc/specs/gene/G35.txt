## ! G35.  Reference database ID for foreign sequence          :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* The value must have the form

<database>:<accession number>

where

* <database> is a valid database name in chado.

*  <accession number> is the accession number of the foreign gene.  

* Did not add code to cope with hashed proformae as that would get complicated, and I don't think we'll be wanting to do that anyway.  Added a message that warns that less checking is done if hashes are used.


Cross-checks with other fields

* 1. If G26 is filled in, G35 must be filled in (NB, not implemented directly, but because of cross check 3 below, will effectively generate an error message if one field is filled in and the other isn't)  

* 2. If G35 is filled in, G26 must be filled in (NB, not implemented directly, but because of cross check 3 below, will effectively generate an error message if one field is filled in and the other isn't)  

* 3. The value in G35 must match the <accession number> portion of the value in G26  


* a small number of spcies are cross-checked (using 'foreign_database' in symtab.pl) to check that the database abbreviation used in G35 matches the species of the gene in G1a.




### Related fields:
G26


### Comments:


### Status:

Not implemented:

* Must be filled in for a new foreign gene

* Must not be filled in for a tag


* Once organism info updated to contain 'official db' info, should use this to cross-check the database used in G35 with the species of the gene in G1a, and remove 'foreign_database' info from symtab.pl
