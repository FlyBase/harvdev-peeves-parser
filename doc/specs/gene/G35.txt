## ! G35.  Reference database ID for foreign sequence          :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* The value must have the form

<database>:<accession number>

where

* <database> is a valid database name in chado.

*  <accession number> is the accession number of the foreign gene.  

* For new non-drosophilid genes, warns if G35 is not filled in.

* Did not add code to cope with hashed proformae as that would get complicated, and I don't think we'll be wanting to do that anyway.  Added a message that warns that less checking is done if hashes are used.


Cross-checks with other fields

* If G26 is filled in and includes an accession number, that accession number must be present in G35.

* If G35 is filled in, G26 must be filled in and the accession number in G35 must match the accession number part of the G26 line.  


* If there is an 'official_db' (SP6 value) in the database for the species of the gene in G1a, then it checks that the accession in G35 is from that database, and warns if not.

* If there is no 'official_db' in the database for the species of the gene in G1a, then it warns if the accession is not from either GB or UniProtKB.


* If G35 is filled in, warns if the FBrf is not FBrf0199194.

### Comments:


### Status:

Not implemented:

* Must be filled in for a new foreign gene



* Once organism info updated to contain 'official db' info, should use this to cross-check the database used in G35 with the species of the gene in G1a, and remove 'foreign_database' info from symtab.pl
