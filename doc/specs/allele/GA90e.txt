### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GA90a -> GA90b, GA90c, GA90d, GA90e, GA90f, GA90g, GA90h, GA90i, GA90j, GA90k


### Checks:

Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90e is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* 'check_site_specific_field' warns if this is filled in by curators not in Harvard.

* sub 'validate_sequence_change' checks format of each line:

 * must begin with a SoftCV specified for the field in the subroutine
   (Amino acid replacement: and Nucleotide substitution: for GA12a)
 * must be of the format XNY, where
    * X is the sequence before the change, N is the coordinate of the change, Y is the change.
    * values allowed for X and Y for the field are specified in the subroutine (see also curation_manual for details)


Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GA90a-GA90k unit):

 * GA90a must be filled in if GA90e is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
