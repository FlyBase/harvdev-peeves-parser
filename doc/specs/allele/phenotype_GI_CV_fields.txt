= General specs for ontology term contents of proforma fields  GA56., GA17., GA28a., GA28b., GA29a., GA29b. =

Note the following specs are in both plain English and BNF.

Quick note on BNF used:

The specs are in extended BNF as defined here:
http://cui.unige.ch/db-research/Enseignement/analyseinfo/AboutBNF.html
with the following additions
1. text strings are all in double quotes
2. ontology terms are defined by the intersection of ID, namespace (NS), subset (S), and ancestor term (A) using a string whose syntax is defined by the following BNF:

<valid ontology term> ::= "<ID:"<id>["+NS:"<namespace>]["+S:"<subset>]["-S:"<subset>]["+A:"<ancestor>]">"

'+S' means use terms from this subset
'-S' means DO NOT use terms from this subset
e.g.:- 
<ID:FBcv+NS:phenotypic_class+S:camcur>
<ID:GO+NS:biological_process+A:cell cycle>
Where a subset is to be avoided, this is marked with '-S' e.g.- 
<ID:FBbt-S:deprecated>

== <Phenotypic class statement> ==

In English:

* A <Phenotypic class statement> = a term from the FBcv namespace 'phenotypic class' and subset='camcur' followed by zero to any number of <Phenotypic class qualifier>.
 * The <Phenotypic class qualifier> term(s) are separated from the
first 'phenotypic class' term and each other by ' | '. 
 * A <Phenotypic class qualifier> is any term from FBdv or any term from FBcv subset='camcur' from the following namespaces: dominance_qualifier; environmental_qualifier; genotype_to_phenotype_relation; homeotic; sex_qualifier.

In BNF

<Phenotypic class statement> ::= <PC>{" | "<PCQ>}
<Phenotypic class> ::= <PC> ::= <ID:FBcv+NS:phenotypic_class+S:camcur>
<Phenotypic class qualifier> ::= <PCQ> ::= <ID:FBcv+NS:dominance_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:clone_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:environmental_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:intensity_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:genotype_to_phenotype_relation+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:homeotic+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:sex_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBdv+NS:default>
;

== <Phenotype manifest in> ==

In English

* <Phenotype manifest in> =  An <anatomy> term, which may optionally be combined with a second anatomy term using an '&'.  This is followed zero or more <anatomy qualifier> terms. The <anatomy qualifier> term(s) are separated from the
<anatomy> terms and each other by ' | '.
* An <anatomy> term is either a term from FBbt, or from GO namespace=cell_component or a term which is a child of the term 'cell cycle' from GO, namespace=biological process.  Terms from FBbt subset:deprecated should not be used.
* An anatomy qualifier may be any term from Fbdv, or any term from FBcv subset='camcur' from the following namespaces: environmental_qualifier; genotype_to_phenotype_relation; sex_qualifier; structural_qualifier; spatial_qualifier; clone_qualifier; intensity_qualifier.

In BNF

<Phenotype manifest in> ::= <A>{" & "<A>}{" | "<AQ>}
<Anatomy> ::= <A> ::= <ID:FBbt-S:deprecated> | <ID:GO+NS:cellular_component> | <ID:GO+NS:biological_process+A:cell cycle>
<Anatomy qualifier> ::= <AQ> ::= <ID:FBcv+NS:environmental_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:genotype_to_phenotype_relation+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:sex_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:structural_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:spatial_qualifier+S:camcur>
<ID:FBcv+NS:clone_qualifier+S:camcur>
;

== <Genetic interaction sub-statement> ==

In English 

A <Genetic interaction sub-statement> consists of a <Genetic interaction type>, which is either the string "UI", the string "non-modified" or a term from FBcv subset=camcur, namespace=genetic_interaction_type, followed by zero or more <Genetic interaction type qualifier> terms. The <Genetic interaction type qualifier> terms are separated from the <Genetic interaction type> term and from each other by ' | '.

The type of <genetic interaction type qualifier> allowed depends on the type of <Genetic interaction type> chosen:
Terms from FBcv subset=camcur with namespace=genotype_to_phenotype_relation,clone_qualifier or sex_qualifier may be used as a qualifier for any genetic interaction type;
The term 'partially' may only be used as a qualifier for the genetic interaction type=suppressible;
Terms from FBcv subset=camcur namespace=environmental_qualifier may only be used as a qualifier for the genetic interaction types: suppressible, enhanceable or UI.

In BNF

<Genetic interaction sub-statement> ::= <GIT>{" | "<GITQ1>} | <GIT2>{" | "<GITQ2>} | <GIT3>{" | "<GITQ3>}
<Genetic interaction type> ::= <GIT> ::= "UI"|"non-modified"|<ID:FBcv+NS:genetic_interaction_type+S:camcur>
<Genetic interaction type qualifier> ::= <GITQ>:: <ID:FBcv+NS:genotype_to_phenotype_relation+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:sex_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:environmental_qualifier+S:camcur>
<GIT2> ::= "suppressible"
<GIT3> ::= "suppressible"|"enhanceable"|"UI"
<GITQ1> ::= <ID:FBcv+NS:genotype_to_phenotype_relation+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:sex_qualifier+S:camcur> | <ID:FBcv+NS:clone_qualifier+S:camcur>
<GITQ2> ::= "partially"
<GITQ3> ::= <ID:FBcv+NS:environmental_qualifier+S:camcur>

! GA56. Phenotypic | dominance class [bipartite CV]    *k :

 Format is:
(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }

(Note: <Phenotypic class statement> defined above)
where
"(with gene1[allele2]) " is optional.

gene1[allele2] may actually be a deficiency/other aberration that
disrupts gene1 rather than an allele; however if it is an allele it
must be an allele of the same gene of which GA1a is an allele, and it must be represented as a GA1a in its own right in this curation record (unless it is a .edit record).

There may be more than one thing in the (with ) section - separated by ", " or by "/"
(heterozygotes at a locus being separated by a /, while combinations at distinct loci
(e.g.  engineered things, duplications, etc) are separated by a ,).

If there is a statement in the allele.pro with GA1a. = "gene1[allele1]"  :

(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }

then there must also be a statement in the allele.pro with GA1a. = "gene1[allele2]"  :

(with gene1[allele1]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }

i.e. the statement should be identical, *except* that "gene1[allele1]"
and "gene1[allele2]" are flipped around in their positions between
GA1a. and being within the "(with )" bit.

Of course, this gets more complicated if there is more than one thing
in the "gene1[allele2]" bit, but perhaps we should get the basic check
in first and then worry about the more complex ones.


" { gene2[allele1] }" is optional. gene2[allele1] is usually a GAL4/GAL80/tetR driver.  There
can be two or more alleles in the {}, separated by ", ", when 2 drivers are used
simultaneously.

In rare cases (but ONLY for descendents of the variegation node of FBcv) gene2[allele1] is
not a GAL4 driver but some other FBobject (FBab, Fbal, FBti, FBba).  All things listed
must either be a valid symbol for relevant FB object type, or instantiated in this
curation record.

For non-descendents of varigation node, all the alleles within the { } should match

^Scer\\GAL(4|80).*

or

^Tn10\\TetR.*

or .*\[.*T:Scer\\GAL(4|80).*\]

or .*\[.*T:Tn10\\TetR.*\]

COMMENTS: The GAL4/GAL80/TetR rules is a hack to be done better later.

! GA28a. Genetic interaction  [CV, class, effect]      *S :

CHECKS: Format is this:

(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }
(Note: <Phenotypic class statement> and <Genetic interaction sub-statement> defined above)

Detailed explanation of format.

NOTE: The beginning part of the format:

"(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }"

is basically similar to what you would write in GA56., and the rest of
the line in GA28a. is extra stuff on top of that. However, the
specification for the "(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }"
section in GA28a. is not *absolutely* identical to
that in GA56. so have specified each bit again below (and have written
where it is identical to checks in GA56. and where it is not)


1. "(with gene1[allele2]) " is optional

**The spec here is IDENTICAL to what is checked in GA56.**

gene1[allele2] may actually be a deficiency/other aberration that
disrupts gene1 rather than an allele; however if it is an allele it
must be an allele of the same gene of which GA1a is an allele, and it must be represented as a GA1a in its own right in this curation record (unless it is a .edit record).

There may be more than one thing in the (with ) section - separated by
", " or by "/" (heterozygotes at a locus being separated by a /, while
combinations at distinct loci (e.g.  engineered things, duplications,
etc) are separated by a ,).

For cases where there is an FBal in the (with ) section, Peeves should
check
for symmetry in the statements in different allele.pro.

i.e.

If there is a statement in the allele.pro with GA1a. =
"gene1[allele1]"  :

(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }

then there must also be a statement in the allele.pro with GA1a. = "gene1[allele2]"  :

(with gene1[allele1]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }


i.e. the statements should be identical, *except* that "gene1[allele1]"
and "gene1[allele2]" are flipped around in their positions between
GA1a. and being within the "(with )" bit.

Of course, this gets more complicated if there is more than one thing
in the "gene1[allele2]" bit, but perhaps we should get the basic check
in first and then worry about the more complex ones.


2. "<Phenotypic class statement>" is optional


3. "{ gene2[allele1] }, " is optional

**The spec here DIFFERS from that in GA56.**

NOTE: for now we have a strict implementation similar to that for GA56,
which only allows GAL4/GAL80. This will be turned off once curators
lean the new system, but for now will give Peeves warinings for every
'triple' interaction.

"gene2[allele1]" must be a valid symbol of type FBal, FBab or FBba (or
a new thing of one of those types made in the curation record). If it
is an FBal, it must NOT be an allele of the same gene of which GA1a is
an allele.

There can be two or more things in the {} - separated by ", " or by "/"
(heterozygotes at a locus being separated by a /, while combinations at
distinct loci (e.g.  engineered things, duplications, etc) are separated by a ',').



4. Notes on the "optional"-ity of the 3 sections above.

a. if any combination of "(with gene1[allele2]) ", "<Phenotypic class statement>" or " {
gene2[allele1] }" are present, then the last bit that is present should
be separated from the <Genetic interaction sub-statement> by ", ". However,
if none of them are present, then the line should start at <Genetic interaction sub-statement>.

i.e. these are legal:

<Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }

(with gene1[allele2]), <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }
<Phenotypic class statement>, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }
{ gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }


(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement>, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }
(with gene1[allele2]) { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }
<Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }

(with gene1[allele2]) <Phenotypic class statement> { gene2[allele1] }, <Genetic interaction sub-statement> { interacting alleles }

EXTRA SPECIES CHECK (not so high priority as format checks above):

for GA28a. (and same for GA18b.) -


- if the allele in GA1a. is NOT a drosophilid species, then
GA28a./GA28b. should not be filled in (the data belongs in GA29a./GA29b.
instead)


- else, if the allele in GA1a. IS a drosophilid species, then each
allele in the 'gene2[allele1]' or 'interacting
alleles' portions that does not match any of the following regular
expressions:

^Scer\\GAL(4|80).*

or

^Tn10\\TetR.*

or .*\[.*T:Scer\\GAL(4|80).*\]

or .*\[.*T:Tn10\\TetR.*\]


must be the same species as the allele in GA1a.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## ! GA28b. Genetic interaction (anatomy, effect) [CV]       *S :

Genetic interaction between two or more genes.  The general format of the data is:  
(with gene1[allele2]) <phenotype > { gene2[allele1] }, <genetic interaction qualifier> { interacting alleles }  
where each portion may have complicated substructure, described below, and some of them may be optional.  
  
The difference between GA28[ab] and GA29[ab]a is that the former must test to see whether  
  -  at least one of gene2[allele1] is the same species as the allele in GA1a  
  -  and must not have data for non-Drosophilid genes.   
  
The difference between GA28/9a and GA28/9b is that the  
	former's phenotype describes the phenotypic class  
	and the latter the body type --- the same relationship as there is between GA56 and GA17  
    
Syntax: Partial BNF, where ::= is the definition operator and || the alternation operator, for the data field is:
