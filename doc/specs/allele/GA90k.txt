## ! GA90k. Molecular nature (type) of lesion :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented) (see Comments below)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GA90a -> GA90b, GA90c, GA90d, GA90e, GA90f, GA90g, GA90h, GA90i, GA90j, GA90k


### Checks:


Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90d is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* 'check_site_specific_field' warns if this is filled in by curators not in Harvard.

in validate_cvterm_field:


* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* each value must be valid term which is specified in symtab.pl as 'lesion_type'



Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GA90a-GA90k unit):

 * GA90a must be filled in if GA90k is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs) 

 * GA90k must be filled in if GA90a is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

### Comments:

!c for GA90k not implemented for perl parser, so set to 'No' for now. !c for this field has been implemented in the python parser so when we switch over to that, !c should be set to 'Yes' again (if Peeves is still needed at that time !)

### Status:

Not yet implemented:

* This field should only be filled in for Dmel alleles ??
