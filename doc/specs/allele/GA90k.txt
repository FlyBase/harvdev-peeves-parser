### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

### Checks:


Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90d is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* 'check_site_specific_field' warns if this is filled in by curators not in Harvard.

in validate_cvterm_field:


* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* each value must be valid term which is specified in symtab.pl as 'lesion_type'



Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GA90a-GA90k unit):

 * GA90a must be filled in if GA90k is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs) 

 * GA90k must be filled in if GA90a is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
