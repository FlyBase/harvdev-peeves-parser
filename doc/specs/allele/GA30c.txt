## ! GA30c. Encoded experimental tool (FBto symbol) :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* check_valid_symbol_field checks that the values are a valid tool or sequence feature symbol either in chado or generated in the record.

Cross-checks between fields:

* if GA30c is filled in

- either the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a)

- or, the allele must be associated with either a 'regular insertion' or a 'TI insertion' (in GA10c/GA10e) AND GA30f must be filled in

(The checks use sub 'get_allele_type' to work out what type of allele is in GA1a based on how GA10a, GA10c, GA10e are filled in).


* Usually only one of GA30c and GA30d are filled in, so a warning is issued if both are filled in.

* For new 'construct' alleles (i.e. GA10a filled in), where the parent gene has a 'common_tool_uses' in chado:

     * Peeves warns if neither of GA30c or GA30d are filled in (a slightly different error message is given in GA35 is filled in).

* If both GA35 and GA30c are filled in:

    * checks whether the entries in GA30c correspond to FBsf that are sequence-targeting reagents (e.g. sgRNA, RNAi_reagent)

      * if they are not sequence targeting reagents, warns that it is unusual for both GA35 and GA30c to be filled in in this case.

      * if they are FBsf that are sequence targeting reagents, checks that the value in GA35 matches the type of the GA30c entries (this information is grabbed from chado for existing FBsf, while a simple mapping between symbol and type is currently used for new FBsf generated in the record) and warns if there is a mis-match (note that if more than one value is present in GA35 it will currently count as a mis-match).

### Comments:

Some of the between fields cross-checks are not carried out for .edit records, to prevent false-positives (e.g. when adding information to already existing alleles that was missed in the original curation).
