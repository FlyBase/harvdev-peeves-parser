## ! GA35. Transgenic product class [CV] :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:


Checks within field:


* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that this is a valid SO term from the expected branches: 'SO:structural_variant', 'SO:functional_effect_variant', 'SO:oligo', 'additional_targeting_GA35', and 'additional_GA35'. The latter two are SO terms not in the first three branches, and are specified in symtab.pl. 'oligo' plus 'additional_targeting_GA35' are the terms expected for transgenes that target a gene of interest using complementary nucleotide sequence and having these separate from 'additional_GA35' will allow for more flexibility when checking GA35 against GA30c once we can put seqfeat in GA30c.

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' also warns if a valid SO term from the 'translational_product_structure_variant branch' is used and suggests using a term from the 'coding_sequence_variant' branch instead.

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' also warns if a valid SO term from the 'incomplete_transcript_variant branch' is used as the definition of terms in this branch mean they are not appropriate for transgenic product class.


* If either 'genomic_DNA' or 'cDNA' is present in GA35, checks that 'wild_type' is also present, as 'genomic_DNA' and 'cDNA' are only supposed to be used with the wild_type term.

Checks between fields:


* if GA35 is filled in, the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a) (i.e. not a classical or insertional allele)

* For new 'construct' alleles (i.e. GA10a filled in):

  * if the parent gene has a 'common_tool_uses' in chado (i.e. usually used as an experimental tool):

     - Peeves warns if neither of GA30c or GA30d are filled in (a slightly different error message is given depending on whether or not GA35 is filled in).

  * if the parent gene of the allele is NOT usually used as an experimental tool

     - Peeves warns if GA35 is empty.

* If both GA35 and GA30c are filled in:

    * checks whether the entries in GA30c correspond to FBsf that are sequence-targeting reagents (e.g. sgRNA, RNAi_reagent)

      * if they are not sequence targeting reagents, warns that it is unusual for both GA35 and GA30c to be filled in in this case.

      * if they are FBsf that are sequence targeting reagents, checks that the value in GA35 matches the type of the GA30c entries (this information is grabbed from chado for existing FBsf, while a simple mapping between symbol and type is currently used for new FBsf generated in the record) and warns if there is a mis-match (note that if more than one value is present in GA35 it will currently count as a mis-match).


* If GA35 is filled in, warns if GA30d is filled in (and vice versa) - prints a field specific message as in rare cases it is OK for both GA35 and GA30d to be filled in.
