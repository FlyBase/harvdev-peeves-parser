## ! GA35. Transgenic product class [CV] :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:


Checks within field:


* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that this is a valid SO term from the expected branches ('structural_variant', 'functional_effect_variant' and 'additional_GA35' terms that are not in the first two branches, but are specified in the @additional_GA35 array in symtab.pl).

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' also warns if a valid SO term from the 'translational_product_structure_variant branch' is used and suggests using a term from the 'coding_sequence_variant' branch instead.

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' also warns if a valid SO term from the 'incomplete_transcript_variant branch' is used as the definition of terms in this branch mean they are not appropriate for transgenic product class.


Checks between fields:

* If GA35 is filled in, warns if GA30c is filled in (and vice versa) - prints a field specific message as in rare cases it is OK for both GA35 and either GA30c/GA30d to be filled in.

* If GA35 is filled in, warns if GA30d is filled in (and vice versa) - prints a field specific message as in rare cases it is OK for both GA35 and either GA30c/GA30d to be filled in.

* if GA35 is filled in, the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a) (i.e. not a classical or insertional allele)

* For new 'construct' alleles (i.e. GA10a filled in):

  * if the parent gene has a 'common_tool_uses' in chado (i.e. usually used as an experimental tool):

     - Peeves warns if neither of GA30c or GA30d are filled in (a slightly different error message is given depending on whether or not GA35 is filled in).

  * if the parent gene of the allele is NOT usually used as an experimental tool

     - Peeves warns if GA35 is empty (unless it has 'in vitro construct - RNAi' in the mutagen field - this is a temporary hack until we can use experimental tool fields to describe this kind of targeting construct)

### Comments:

The constraint using 'in vitro construct - RNAi' should be removed when we implement using experimental tool fields to describe targeting constructs such as RNAi, sgRNA lines. (JIRA DC-910).

Have not put in a test for GA35 being filled in for a targeting construct, because it will trip the general 'not valid in this field' check as the relevant SO terms are not in the allowed set for GA35.
