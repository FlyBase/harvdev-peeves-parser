## ! GA90a. Allele to which GA90b-k apply [dupl for multiple] :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GA90a -> GA90b, GA90c, GA90d, GA90e, GA90f, GA90g, GA90h, GA90i, GA90j, GA90k


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* Value in GA90a must either be:
  * same as value in GA1a
  or
  * have the format <symbol in GA1a>-<integer> eg. en[1]-1, en[1]-2 etc.


 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90a is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* 'check_site_specific_field' warns if this is filled in by curators not in Harvard.


Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GA90a-GA90k unit):

 * GA90a must be filled in if any of GA90[b-k] are filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

 * The same value must not be present in more than one GA90a field in a single proforma (sub check_for_duplicated_field_values)
