## ! GA30d. Encoded experimental tool [CV]          :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks it is a valid FBcv term from the 'experimental_tool_descriptor' namespace

Cross-checks between fields:

* if GA30d is filled in

- either the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a)

- or, the allele must be associated with either a 'regular insertion' or a 'TI insertion' (in GA10c/GA10e) AND GA30f must be filled in

(The checks use sub 'get_allele_type' to work out what type of allele is in GA1a based on how GA10a, GA10c, GA10e are filled in).


* Usually only one of GA30c and GA30d are filled in, so a warning is issued if both are filled in.

* For new 'construct' alleles (i.e. GA10a filled in), where the parent gene has a 'common_tool_uses' in chado, Peeves warns if neither of GA30c or GA30d are filled in.

### Comments:

Some of the between fields cross-checks are not carried out for .edit records, to prevent false-positives (e.g. when adding information to already existing alleles that was missed in the original curation).
