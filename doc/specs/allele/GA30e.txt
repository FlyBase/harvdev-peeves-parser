## ! GA30e. Regulatory region(s) present (symbol)  :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* check_valid_symbol_field checks that the values are a valid gene, tool or sequence feature symbol either in chado or generated in the record.

Checks between fields:

* If GA30e is filled in:

 - the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a)

* If the allele in GA1a is new, and it is associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a), a warning is issued if GA30e is not filled in (since it is usually filled in under these circumstances).

(The checks use sub 'get_allele_type' to work out what type of allele is in GA1a based on how GA10a, GA10c, GA10e are filled in).


### Related fields:



### Comments:

Some of the between fields cross-checks are not carried out for .edit records, to prevent false-positives (e.g. when adding information to already existing alleles that was missed in the original curation).
