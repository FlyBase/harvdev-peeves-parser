## ! GA30a. Tagged with experimental tool (FBto symbol)        :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* check_valid_symbol_field checks that the values are a valid tool symbol either in chado or generated in the record.

Checks between fields:


* if GA30a is filled in

 - either the allele must be associated with a 'construct' (in GA10a)

 - or, the allele must be associated with a 'TI insertion' (in GA10c/GA10e)

 - or, the allele must be associated with a 'regular insertion' (in GA10c/GA10e) AND GA30f must be filled in

(The check uses sub 'get_allele_type' to work out what type of allele is in GA1a based on how GA10a, GA10c, GA10e are filled in).

### Comments:

Some of the between fields cross-checks are not carried out for .edit records, to prevent false-positives (e.g. when adding information to already existing alleles that was missed in the original curation).
