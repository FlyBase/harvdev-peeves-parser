## ! GA10e. Associated insertion - G1a is inside insert   *G :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented in validate_GA10ce)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented in validate_GA10ce)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented in validate_GA10ce)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Check in Peeves after first-pass check for newly instantiated and invalidated symbols:

* if the insertion is marked as 'NEW:' but it is already a valid FBti in chado, then issue an error message.

* if the insertion symbol has not been marked as instantiated in the record (i.e. it did not have a 'NEW:' prefix in the GA10c/GA10e field or there is not an insertion proforma for it) and it is not a valid FBti symbol in chado, then issue an error message.


Checks in validate_GA10ce

* if the insertion is created new in the record (i.e. either has 'NEW:' prefix in GA10c/GA10e or made in insertion proforma)

  * uses 'check_insertion_symbol_format' subroutine to check the insertion symbol format (see ti/MA1a.txt for details of subroutine)

  * for GA10c, issues a warning if the identifier portion of the insertion symbol does not match the allele symbol in GA1a

* if the insertion is already in chado
  * warns if the allele in GA1a is new: "Did you intend to associate an existing TI with a new allele?"
  * warns if the allele in GA1a is not already associated with the FBti in chado.

### Comments:

validate_GA10ce does cross-checking with values in GA1a - in most cases of cross-checks like this, they are done at the end of the proforma (in case of odd order of fields) rather than within a subroutine that checks a single field.  Not sure why there is a difference.

Also, the for loop that goes through the entries in GA10c/GA10e does not use $hash_entries "in case of hash list mismatch" rather than the general case where the check is only done once the hashing is OK.

Might be worth standardising this with other fields and making this an end of proforma cross-check at some point.


### Status:

doc reflects what has been implemented.

Not yet implemented:

If a curator makes a new insertion in GA10c/GA10e marked with 'NEW:' and also puts in an insertion proforma for that insertion, this 'double-flagging' of a new insertion generates no error message, and it should as it causes the record to bounce on parsing.   (see DC-497 for details)
