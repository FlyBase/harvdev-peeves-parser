## ! GA21.  Interallelic complementation or rescue data [SoftCV]    *Q :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes

### !c Applicable:

No

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

SoftCV values that may be entered are

Rescues: 
Fails to rescue: 
Partially rescues: 
Complements: 
Fails to complement: 
Partially complements: 

and each line must begin with one of the above phrases.

These fields capture complementation/rescue relationships between alleles of the same
gene.

For these 3:

Complements: 
Fails to complement: 
Partially complements: 

the format is simply gene1[allele2]


Where the allele identified in GA1a and gene1[allele2] position must be alleles of the same
gene.

For these 3:

Rescues: 
Fails to rescue: 
Partially rescues: 


For the Rescues/Fails to rescue/Partially rescues set of prefices, a
'(with..)' statement may additionally be present.  The format for these is:

(with gene1[allele4]) gene1[allele2]/gene1[allele3] { gene2[allele1] }

"/gene1[allele3]" is optional.  "/gene1[allele3]" may actually be a
deficiency or other aberration that disrupts gene1 rather than an allele.
Further, gene1[allele3] can explicitly be a /+.  If "/gene1[allele3]" is
an allele, it must be an allele of the same gene of which GA1a is an allele.

"gene1[allele2]" may also actually be a deficiency/other aberration that disrupts gene1
rather than an allele (whether it is present on its own or with gene1[allele3]), but if
"/gene1[allele2]" is an allele, it must be an allele of the same gene of which GA1a is an
allele.

"gene1[allele2]" can also be either '+' or '-'

" { gene2[allele1] }" is optional.  gene2[allele1] is a GAL4/GAL80/tetR driver.
gene2[allele1] must be an allele of a gene other than that of which GA1a is an allele.
There can actually be multiple GAL4/driver alleles in the {}, separated by ", ", when more
than one driver is are used simultaneously.  "(with gene1[allele4]) " is optional,
gene1[allele4] is usually another construct allele of gene1, like gene1[allele1] is.

A further check for the Complements/Fails to complement/Partially
complements is that the reciprocations are explicitly curated in the record.
