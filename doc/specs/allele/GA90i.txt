## ! GA90i. Orientation relative to chromosome (+/-) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GA90a -> GA90b, GA90c, GA90d, GA90e, GA90f, GA90g, GA90h, GA90i, GA90j, GA90k


### Checks:

Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90i is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* 'check_site_specific_field' warns if this is filled in by curators not in Harvard.

* validate_cvterm_field checks that the value is allowed for this field - allowed values are stored in symtab.pl with type 'orientation'


Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GA90a-GA90k unit):

 * GA90a must be filled in if GA90i is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

### Comments:



### Status:

Not yet implemented:

* This field should only be filled in for Dmel alleles ??

* I suspect that this field has some dependencies on other GA90 fields apart from GA90a, but this would need further specification before trying to implement it.
