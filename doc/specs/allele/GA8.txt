## ! GA8.   Mutagen [CV]                                  *o :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

checks within field (in validate_cvterm_field):

* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* each value must be valid term (i.e. does not have is_obsolete: true) from
flybase_controlled_vocabulary.obo, and the term must be in the 'origin_of_mutation' namespace 

* If the term used is a child of 'in vitro construct' (EXCEPT 'in vitro construct - RNAi') warns that the child term is now deprecated (now that we are curating GA35 field) and reminds to use 'in vitro construct' instead. (This check can be removed once the child terms now 'replaced' by GA35 curation have been removed from the ontology, but they need to be kept in place in chado for now until retrofit for GA35 has been done, and any relevant derivation scripts have all been updated, so adding this warning for now rather than removed the terms from the ontology immediately).


Checks between fields (done at end of proforma parsing)

 * If it is a new transgenic construct allele (new allele for which GA10a is filled in), GA8 must be filled in.

### Status:

Not implemented:

"Where GA8 has value and GA10g value is an aberration, curator may or may not have
explicitly entered value in A4."  If they did, then GA8 must equal that given in A4.
