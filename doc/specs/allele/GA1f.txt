## ! GA1f.  Action - merge these alleles (symbols)                 :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (separated by returns)
Implemented (in validate_x1f)

### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_x1f)

### Inclusion essential:

No
Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented (in validate_x1f)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field

  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if G1e is filled in

  * checks in validate_x1f:
    * if field contains data, each entry in list must be separated by returns
    * each entry in list must be a valid allele symbol in Chado
    * there must be at least two entries (i.e. allele symbols) in the list
    * there must not be any duplications in the list (checked using check_for_duplicated_lines subroutine)

Cross-checks with other fields

  * checks done after parsing entire proforma

    * 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' (check when x1h filled in)

    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  GA1e and GA1f must not both contain data

    * sub 'plingc_merge_check' - no !c in proforma if GA1f is filled in


    * If GA1f is filled in, GA2c must not be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')

### Comments:

'validate_x1f' subroutine still uses dehash, despite the fact that 'no_hashes_in_proforma' has been added to the basic field checks (before validate_G1e is called).  The dehash is necessary for later cross-checks in the gene proforma (cross-checking G1f data with other fields (G32)), so this should be left in the validate_x1f subroutine.
