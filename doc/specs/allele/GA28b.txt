### Multiple values allowed:

Yes on newlines

### !c Applicable:

No

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

See phenotype_GI_CV_fields.txt for details.
    

 Note, list of allowed qualifier 'types' for phenotype manifest lines (in both GA17 and GA28b, GA29b) is now specified using a list of allowed namespeces in symtab.pl in the @phenotype_manifest_qualifiers array (it no longer uses the Proforma field comment present in FBcv.obo).

Other checks:  
  
withs    
drivers have valid symbols  
do_phen_bodytype  
do_phen_class  
   
			
### Error messages
  
Syntax:  
I think you may have omitted the final ' }' in '<one_line_of_interaction_data>', so I'm adding one and carrying on, hoping for the best.  
I think you may have missed a space before the final } in '<one_line_of_interaction_data>', so I'm inserting one and carrying on, hoping for the best.  
Note: Peeves does NOT change the file: this is for checking.  
I can't find the interacting_alleles in '<one_line_of_interaction_data>' --- did you omit that data, or a curly bracket or a space perhaps?  
  
If pling-c:  
can't use !c in this field  
  
can't have data '<interaction_list>' for a non-drosophilid species <spps> in GA1a.  Perhaps you should have put it in GA29.  
		
If missing or an empty line among the others:  
Missing phenotype in '<phenotype>'  
  
Compound terms disallowed:  
  Compounding anatomy and cell component terms using ' & ' is no longer allowed ('<you entry & next ontology>')  
  
GO biological cell cycle branch process no longer valid here:    
  Valid GO biological process (cell cycle) but term no longer required ('<you entry & next ontology>')  
  
If a non-allowed item:  
won't validate

   Ticket #581, #621 (Add FBdv terms)  
   Ticket #594 (Enhanced error message)  
   Ticket #599 (Body parts with commas)  
   Ticket #596, #597, #620 (Suggests spec. needs enhancing)  
DC-137 JIRA ticket fixed to disallow ontology from the GO 'cell cycle' branch. Simply won't check.  
Could put in a 'no longer allowed' message for the cell cycle entry.
