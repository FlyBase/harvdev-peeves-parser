Checks within field:

- sub no_stamps checks that there are no stamps within this field

Checks between fields:

- If DB2b is filled in, DB2a must be filled in.

- sub check_changes_with_chado carries out the following checks between the data in the DB2a proforma field and any data which is already in chado for that field. The DB2b field is used to provide the 'change/add' information required for these checks.

   - if the data is being changed
     - warns if there isn't already data in chado (prints a warning both when the proforma field is filled in and when it is empty)
     - warns if trying to change data to the value already in chado

   - if data is being added and there is already data for that field in chado
     - warns if the data in the proforma field is not identical to what is already in chado (suggests that perhaps the curator was trying to change existing data)
