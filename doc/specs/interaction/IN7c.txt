## ! IN7c. Subregion(s) of participant(s) with role in interaction ( <link to>  <description> region <role> unspecified role <coordinates/seq>  <note> ) :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field (sub validate_and_crosscheck_IN7cd):

- report an error if the line does not match the basic '<link to>  <description>  <role>  <coordinates/seq>  <note>' format

- report an error if any of the <link to>, <description> or <role> sub-fields are empty (NB, no error is reported if <coordinates/seq> or <note> is empty, as they are optional).

- information in the <link to> subfield must be a valid FBtr or FBpp symbol, either in chado or generated in record.

- 'check_allowed_characters' sub ensures that information in the <description> sub-field matches a limited set of characters - ' is not allowed, so this is not included in the list (**NOTE: may have set this too strict - if get too many false positives, can change set so more characters allowed or change how the check works if its no helpful as is).


- if there is any <note> sub-field information, it is checked as follows:

  - sub trim_space_from_ends checks for superfluous white-space at beginning/end of sub-field info
  - check_stamps checks validity of symbols in stamps

- information in the <role> sub-field:

  - must be a valid PSI-MI term or an error is printed.
  - if it is a valid PSI-MI term, but does not match one of the commonly used terms listed below, a warning message is printed indicating that the term used is not commonly used for this field:

           sufficient binding region
           necessary binding region
           mutation disrupting interaction
           mutation decreasing interaction
           mutation increasing interaction
           enzyme target
           unspecified role

  
Between fields:

- <link to> sub-field symbol should be present in the <symbol> sub-field of at least one of the IN6 lines in the proforma

Within field


- syntax of <coordinates/seq> sub-field should be as follows:

	1) start with 'nt', then a space, then a natural number. e.g., nt 253
	2) start with 'nt', then a space, then a two natural numbers separated by a dash '-'. e.g., nt 1-131
	3) start with 'aa', then a space, then a natural number. e.g., aa 356
	4) start with 'aa', then a space, then a two natural numbers separated by a dash '-'. e.g., aa 400-652
	5) an RNA sequence represented by a string of uppercase letters. Only A, C, G and U are allowed.
	6) a polypeptide sequence represented by a string of uppercase letters. No need to restrict letters allowed (want some flexibility here).
