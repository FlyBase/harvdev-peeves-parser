- 'check_allowed_characters' sub ensures that information in the <description> sub-field matches a limited set of characters - ' is not allowed, so this is not included in the list (**NOTE: may have set this too strict - if get too many false positives, can change set so more characters allowed or change how the check works if its no helpful as is).

  - sub trim_space_from_ends checks for superfluous white-space at beginning/end of sub-field info
  - check_stamps checks validity of symbols in stamps

- information in the <role> sub-field:

  - must be a valid PSI-MI term or an error is printed.
  - if it is a valid PSI-MI term, but does not match one of the commonly used terms listed below, a warning message is printed indicating that the term used is not commonly used for this field:
