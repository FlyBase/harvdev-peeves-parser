### Multiple values allowed:

### !c Applicable:

No (implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

### Checks:

Checks within field (sub validate_IN6):

- report an error if the line does not match the basic '<symbol>  <ID_as_reported>  <role>  <qual/note>' format

- report an error if any of the <symbol>, <ID_as_reported> or <role> sub-fields are empty (NB, no error is reported if <qual/note> is empty, as that is optional).

- information in the <symbol> subfield must be a valid FBtr or FBpp symbol, either in chado or generated in record.

- sub trim_space_from_ends checks for superfluous white-space at beginning/end of the <ID_as_reported> sub-field

- if there is any <note> sub-field information, it is checked as follows:

  - sub trim_space_from_ends checks for superfluous white-space at beginning/end of sub-field info
  - check_stamps checks validity of symbols in stamps
  
- the <role> must be a valid PSI-MI CV term that is a child of either 'experimental role' or 'biological role'.

Within field



- should the max number of lines be two, and if role = 'self' max number of lines = 1 ? 


Between fields:

- could add a cross-check with IN2a so that if description is RNA-protein there must be an -XR symbol and an -XP symbol, whereas if the description is protein-protein, all symbols must be -XP
