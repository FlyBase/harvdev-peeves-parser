### Status:

!c Applicable status is currently set to 'No' because !c of this field has not yet been implemented in the proforma parsing software.

Note, took out additional requirement for value to be 'child of either the 'interaction detection method' or 'participant identification method' term.' as it was causing too many false-positives.
