### Status:

Not yet implemented:

Interactions guidelines doc indicates that this field has a semi-controlled syntax, being 'a three part sentence separated by semi-colons':

<Source was ... /Interaction in vitro>; <free text describing the origin of the first interacting feature (usually bait)>; <free text describing the origin of the second interacting feature (usually prey)>.


The first portion either be 'Interaction in vitro' OR must start with 'Source was '

Examples:
Source was adult heads of wild-type fly line; bait produced from endogenous gene; prey produced from endogenous gene.
Interaction in vitro; enzyme produced as tagged protein in transfected S2 cells; enzyme target produced as tagged protein in bacterial system.

Have not yet added checks for this semi-controlled format.
