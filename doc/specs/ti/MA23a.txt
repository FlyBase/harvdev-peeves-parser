## ! MA23a. Insertion-affected gene reported (dupl for multiple) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): MA23a -> MA23b, MA23c, MA23g


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if A91a is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

Checks within field, using'check_valid_symbol_field':

* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* checks value is a valid symbol of a gene in chado/generated in the record

Checks between fields:

* The same value must not be present in more than one MA23a field in a single proforma (sub check_for_duplicated_field_values)

 * MA23a must be filled in if any of MA23[bcg] are filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
