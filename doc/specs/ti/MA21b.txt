   * the only exception is if MA21a is being !c-ed to nothing (ie. removing sequence location) - in this specific case MA21b should be blank.

      * if MA21b is filled in when MA21a is !c to nothing, a message is printed so that the curator can double-check whether they were trying to !c MA21a to nothing, or failed to fill in the corrected sequence location in MA21a by mistake.
