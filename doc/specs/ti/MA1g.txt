### Inclusion essential:

### Mandatorially has value:

No
Implemented (in validate_merge_using_ids)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

  * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if MA1g is filled in

  * checks in validate_merge_using_ids:
    * if field contains data, each entry in list must be separated by returns
    * there must be at least two entries (i.e. FBti numbers) in the list
    * there must not be any duplications in the list (checked using check_for_duplicated_lines subroutine)

    * if an entry matches the expected format (i.e. FBti[0-9]{7}) it checks that it is valid in Chado and warns if not,
    * otherwise, if it matches the general format of an FBid, warns that it is not the type of FBid expected for that field,
    * otherwise, if it matches the valid *symbol* of the FBid type expected (i.e. someone entered an insertion symbol instead of an id by mistake), warns that a symbol has been entered, and provides the valid FBti number for that symbol, so that it can easily be entered instead,
    * otherwise, warns that it is not a valid FBid format.

Cross-checks with other fields:

    * sub 'plingc_merge_check' - no !c in entire proforma if MA1g is filled in

    * sub 'rename_merge_check' -  MA1c and MA1g must not both contain data


Cross-checks with other fields

   * subroutine 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details of what this subroutine does.
