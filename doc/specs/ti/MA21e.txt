### Status:

It is not clear from the curation manual whether or not there are any cross-field dependencies (none have been implemented in peeves) - none are explicitly mentioned, but there is a hint that MA21e should only be filled in when MA21a is filled in (??) - so if that does turn out to be the case, a cross-check for this would need adding.
