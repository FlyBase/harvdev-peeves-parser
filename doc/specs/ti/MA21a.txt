## ! MA21a. Genomic location of insertion (dupl for multiple) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field

* 'validate_sequence_location' checks that the general format of the sequence location is:

 	arm:x..y

	where:

	* 'arm' is a valid chromosomal arm (currently stored in symtab.pl)

	* '..y' is optional (ie. if the sequence location is a single value rather than a range)

    * for a range, y >= x (i.e. issue a warning if x > y)


Cross-checks with other fields

* if MA21b is filled in, MA21a must be filled in
