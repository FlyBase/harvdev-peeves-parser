## ! MA21a. Genomic location of insertion (dupl for multiple) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field

* 'validate_sequence_location' checks that the general format of the sequence location is:

 	arm:x..y

	where:

	* 'arm' is a valid chromosomal arm (currently stored in symtab.pl)

	* '..y' is optional (ie. if the sequence location is a single value rather than a range)

    * for a range, y >= x (i.e. issue a warning if x > y)


Cross-checks with other fields

* if MA21a is filled in, MA21b must be filled in

   * the only exception is if MA21a is being !c-ed to nothing (ie. removing sequence location) - in this specific case MA21b should be blank.

      * if MA21b is filled in when MA21a is !c to nothing, a message is printed so that the curator can double-check whether they were trying to !c MA21a to nothing, or failed to fill in the corrected sequence location in MA21a by mistake.


* if MA21b is filled in, MA21a must be filled in
