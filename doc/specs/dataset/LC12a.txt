## ! LC12a. Experimental entity [FB gene symbol] :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): LC12a -> LC12b, LC12c


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if LC12a is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* value must be a valid uniquename in chado for any of the following types of feature: FBgn, FBal, FBab, FBti, FBtp, FBcl, FBsf, FBtr, FBpp, FBmc




Checks between fields:

* LC12b must be filled in if LC12a is filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

* If LC12c is filled in, LC12a must be filled in. (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
