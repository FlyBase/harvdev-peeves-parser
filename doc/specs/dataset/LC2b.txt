## ! LC2b. Type of dataset data [CV]    :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:


Cross-checks done after parsing the entire proforma:

(because allowed value depends on value in LC2a field (or equivalent in chado, which is library.type_id)

* validate_ontology_term_id_field subroutine checks that:

  * each line has the format <term ; id> and is from the 'dataset_entity_type' namespace of FBcv

  * in detail, it uses 'check_ontology_term_id_pair' to check that:

    * term is valid and from the particular namespace required for the field.
    * id is valid and from the particular namespace required for the field.
    * term and id match each other.
    * term is not flagged with 'do_not_annotate' or 'do_not_manually_annotate' type flags


Allowed namespace depends on the 'entity type' of the dataset (value in LC2a (for new/merged datasets) or library.type_id in chado (for renamed/existing datasets), as follows:

dataset entity type (LC2a)	namespace allowed in LC2b
project						project_type
biosample					biosample_type
assay						assay_type
result						result_type
reagent collection			reagent_collection_type
