Note: data from this field ends up as a single libraryprop in chado, so specs for proforma parsing will say 'Single' in the equivalent to 'Multiple values allowed', but because this text can contain paragraphs, it is implemented as 'Multiple values allowed : Yes' in Peeves, since for Peeves 'Single' means a single line.
