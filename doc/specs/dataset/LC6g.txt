### Status:

Not yet implemented:

Checks between fields:

- make check to cope with (look at pub checks): A new title supplied for a dataset with an existing (non-null) title is ignored unless curator used "!c" - will need to know where lives: synonym of type "fullname" or "title" and also help with sql query.

Have put code in that should work (marked with ## at end of proforma checks), but will need to add a $prepared_queries{'chado_dataset_title'} to chado.pl and test properly once have correct query and this is in production database.
