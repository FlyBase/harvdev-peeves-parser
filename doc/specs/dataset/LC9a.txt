### Comments:

Note: specs for proforma parsing say 'Single' in the equivalent to 'Multiple values allowed' because each entry in this field represents a single table, but since the table is made up of multiple lines (one line for each Table row), it is implemented as 'Multiple values allowed : Yes' in Peeves, since for Peeves 'Single' means a single line.
