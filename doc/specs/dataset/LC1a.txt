### Checks:

Checks within field:

Checks within validate_primary_proforma_field:

  *  sub validate_primary_proforma_field (see doc/specs/allele/GA1a.txt for details)

Checks between fields:

* I think that the check for validity of the symbol in this field (either valid FBlc symbol in chado/generated in record) should happen as part of the cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields subroutine below.


   * subroutine 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details of what this subroutine does.
