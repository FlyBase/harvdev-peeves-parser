## ! LC14a. Dataset assay/collection is assay_of this biosample  :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

Must be a valid FBlc with the entity type 'biosample'

* validate_correct_dataset_entity_type does:

   * check_for_duplicated_lines:

    * warns if there is a blank line within the data
    * warns if there are any duplicated values

   * checks each value is a valid dataset/collection (i.e. FBlc) symbol:
	    * either in chado - in which case it checks that the entity type in chado matches the type required for this field

	    * or generated in record - in which case it issues a warning that it cannot yet check that the the entity type in chado matches the type required for this field

    * if the value is not a valid dataset/collection (i.e. FBlc) symbol (either in chado/generated in record), generates a warning message.

### Status:

Not yet implemented: 

Cannot yet check that the entity type is correct if the value is a new dataset generated in the record, but does at least warn the curator that they need to check this manually.


- Any value in LC14a must not be the same as the value in LC1a (cannot just use compare_field_pairs as multiple values are allowed in LC14a - use compare_pub_fbrf_containing_fields as a template to make generic subroutine)
