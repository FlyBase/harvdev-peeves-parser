## ! LC99d. Action - dissociate accession in LC99a/LC99b from dataset in LC1f/LC1a? (y/blank)  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): LC99a -> LC99b, LC99c, LC99d


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* if LC99d is filled in, 'check_single_allowed_value' subroutine checks that the only allowed value is 'y'

Checks between fields:

* If LC99d is filled in, LC99a must be filled in

* If LC99d is filled in, LC99b must be filled in

* Since LC99d is a 'correction of existing data' field, it must not be filled in for:
  * a completely new dataset
  * a dataset merge (suspect using LC99d for a merge is not allowed since a merge involves making a new FBid, but need to check this with Kathleen ??)

### Comments:

Curation manual says 'Single OK. Multiple untested.' for the 'Multiple values allowed' section, but have implemented it as a single line field as the only allowed value is 'y'


### Status:

If LC99d is filled in, no checks are done to make sure that the accession (specified in LC99a and LC99b) is actually associated with the dataset (specified by LC1a) in chado.
