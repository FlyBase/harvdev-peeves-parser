## ! LC12b. Type of experimental entity [CV]  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)



### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): LC12a -> LC12b, LC12c


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if LC12a is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).


* value must be one of the following (stored as lookup in symtab.pl (type 'LC12b_value') as is only a subset of the existing library_featureprop type fields):

allele_used 
depletion_target 
RNAi_target 
 inhibitor_target 
activator_target 
antibody_target 
bait_protein 
bait_RNA 
transgene_used 
overexpressed_factor 
ectopic_factor
experimental_design


Checks between fields:

* LC12b must be filled in if LC12a is filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
* If LC12c is filled in, LC12b must be filled in. (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

### Comments:

In the end I did not use a chado query to get *all* the library_featureprop type out of chado for this field, as it only accepts a subset. I have added the code I worked out that would do that below, in case I need it (or similar) for a future Peeves check:

# in chado.pl

	$prepared_queries{'library_featureprop_type'} = $chado->prepare ('SELECT cvterm.name
								  FROM cvterm, cv
								  WHERE cv.name = \'library_featureprop type\'
								  AND cv.cv_id = cvterm.cv_id
								  AND cvterm.is_obsolete = \'0\';');


# in symtab.pl


# ask chado for current list of values allowed in LC12b and store in symbol table

	my $library_featureprop_type_list = chat_to_chado ('library_featureprop_type');

	foreach my $value (@{$library_featureprop_type_list}) {

		my ($prop) = @{$value};
		warn "Got one: $prop\n";
		set_symbol ($prop, 'chado_library_featureprop_type', '1');

	}





### Status:

Could add a check to symtab.pl to double-check that the terms in the hard-coded lookup are still valid library_featureprop type in chado.
