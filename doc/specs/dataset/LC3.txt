### Status:

Not yet implemented: 

Cross-checks between fields:

- The value in LC3 must not be the same as the value in LC1a (cannot just use compare_field_pairs as multiple values are allowed in LC3 - use compare_pub_fbrf_containing_fields as a template to make generic subroutine)


- The value in LC3 must be of type "project" or "result" only.
