### Status:

NOTE: the check for 'must be a Dmel gene' is implicated in a hacky way just using the symbol given - it should eventually be replaced with a test that looks up the organism info from chado.

NOTE: 'parent entity' cross-check only uses HH2a field at the moment, ideally, should look up value in chado if HH2a is empty
