### Dupl. for multiple field:

Checks within field:

Checks between fields:

* Must NOT be filled in for 'parent entity'

### Comments:



### Status:

NOTE: 'parent entity' cross-check only uses HH2a field at the moment, ideally, should look up value in chado if HH2a is empty


Not yet implemented:

Checks within field:


- need to replace 'must NOT be a Dmel gene' with 'must be a mammalian gene' - this needs to wait until this info is actually in chado
