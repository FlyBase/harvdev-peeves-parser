## !     HH7d. Orthologous Dmel gene(s) [usu. DIOPT] :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented) (check with Kathleen)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): HH7e -> HH7d, HH7c


### Checks:

Checks within fields:

validate_Dmel_gene subroutine checks:

* must be a valid gene symbol *in chado* (so a gene made in the same record does not count)

   * must be a Dmel gene

Checks between fields:


* If HH7d is filled in, HH7e must be filled in

* Must NOT be filled in for 'parent entity'

### Comments:



### Status:


NOTE: the check for 'must be a Dmel gene' is implicated in a hacky way just using the symbol given - it should eventually be replaced with a test that looks up the organism info from chado.

NOTE: 'parent entity' cross-check only uses HH2a field at the moment, ideally, should look up value in chado if HH2a is empty
