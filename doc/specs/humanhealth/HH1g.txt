### Status:

[NB: cross-checking is in place to cope with FBhh merges, even though at the moment there is no merge field in the proforma, so it should still work if/when a merge field is implemented (code currently assumes it will have the field designation HH3b, so if that is not the case the cross-checking code will need updating to use the actual field designation used for a merge]
