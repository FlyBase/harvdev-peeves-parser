Not yet implemented:

Checks within field:

* value(s) must be a valid FBhh id

Checks between fields (see DC-621)

* HH2b must be filled in if 'HH1f' is 'new' and HH2a is 'sub-entity'

* HH2b can be filled in if 'HH1f' contains an FBhh id, but in this case, HH2b must be !c (ought to also include check that HH2b/equivalent place in chado is 'sub-entity' for complete checking)
