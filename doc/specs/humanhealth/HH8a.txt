## ! HH8a. Dmel gene(s) implicated (repeat for multiple) :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (implemented) (check with Kathleen)


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): HH8a -> HH8c


### Checks:

Checks within field:

validate_Dmel_gene subroutine checks:

* must be a valid gene symbol *in chado* (so a gene made in the same record does not count)

   * must be a Dmel gene




Checks between fields:


* If HH8c is filled in, HH8a must be filled in.

* Must NOT be filled in for 'parent entity'

### Comments:



### Status:

NOTE: the check for 'must be a Dmel gene' is implicated in a hacky way just using the symbol given - it should eventually be replaced with a test that looks up the organism info from chado.

NOTE: 'parent entity' cross-check only uses HH2a field at the moment, ideally, should look up value in chado if HH2a is empty
