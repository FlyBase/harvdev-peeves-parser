Note from Kathleen in PDEV-18: Cannot !c SF2b  as it's an essential to identify a feature in the database along with organism and uniquename.

### Status:


Need to check with chado whether 'peptide' is a valid SO term - curation manual says that these values should be a valid SO term, but cannot see it in Vocabularies.  If it is supposed to be a valid SO term, should add additional check to list in symtab.pl to check that they are still valid SO terms.

Could possible replace hard-coded symtab.pl with chado query of the correct 'property_type'
