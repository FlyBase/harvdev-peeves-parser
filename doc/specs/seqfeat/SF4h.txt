## !   SF4h. Orientation of feature in SF4a relative to the chromosome ("+"/"-")  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (implemented) ??need to check with Kathleen whether !c implemented or applicable for this field (or will it automatically be corrected if !c genome location field SF4a??)- implemented as No for now.


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (implemented): SF4a -> SF4b, SF4h (see status below)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that the value is one of the allowed values for this field  - allowed values are stored in symtab.pl with type 'orientation'

Checks between fields (for each duplication of the SF4a, SF4b, SF4h unit):


  * SF4a must be filled in if SF4h is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
