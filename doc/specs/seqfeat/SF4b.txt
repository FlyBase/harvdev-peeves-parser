### Checks:

Checks within field:

* must be the number of the current genome release (stored in symtab.pl).

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if SF4b is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).


Checks between fields (for each duplication of the SF4a, SF4b, SF4h unit):


  * SF4a must be filled in if SF4b is filled in and vice versa (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
