### Comments:



### Status:

The within field check currently only allows a valid species abbreviation, but curation manual also says 'May use "synthetic construct".' as well as saying it must be a valid species abbreviation so its possible the check is currently a bit too strict.

Not yet implemented:

Have not yet implemented the field cross-check 'avoid subequent use' (i.e. don't fill in for existing seqfeat), as the field is filled in by default in the proforma.  When switch over species checks to using chado organism table, see if can add check for existing seqfeats that species of seqfeat in chado must match species abbreviation in SF3b.
