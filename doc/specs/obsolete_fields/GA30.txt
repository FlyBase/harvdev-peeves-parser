### Status:

Not yet implemented:

Cross-checks between field

* If G30 has value then GA1a must contain the string 'T:' within the [] (ideally it should check for the tag string, with conversion of a tag[allele] to tag-allele before checking

* The reciprocal check is that if GA1a is new and contains a 'T:' within the [], then GA30 must have value.
