## ! LC5.  Experimental protocol, vector (or common construct) :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field;

Checks within field, using'check_valid_symbol_field':

* check_for_duplicated_lines:
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data
   * warns if there are any duplicated values

* Each value must be a valid FBmc symbol (either already in the database or generated in the
curation record). NOTE curation manual says any value must be 'a feature with FBmc IDs of type "engineered_construct"', implying that not all FBmc are 'engineered_construct'.  I checked chado and there were just a few (10) non-obsolete FBmc that are not 'engineered_construct', but I think that they may be errors, so just implemented the simple 'must be a valid FBmc symbol' for now as already had code that could do that easily.
