When the 'FBmp' uniquename type is introduced into Chado the value
required in P21 will change appropriately.

The cross-check between P21, P2 and P22 is being
re-evaluated and may be replaced by a much simpler check in future.
If the simpler check is adopted the P21 field may be removed
from the publication proforma.
