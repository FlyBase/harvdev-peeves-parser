## ! G12b. Comments, not allele-specific - mutants            *p :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.

### !c Applicable:

Yes if G1a contains valid data and G1g contains 'y', otherwise no.

### Inclusion essential:

No.

### Mandatorially has value:

No.

### Checks:

The value may consist of an arbitrary amount of text, including layout
such as multiple lines and paragraphs, subject to the following
restrictions:

* any text delimited by @ characters must be a symbol of any FBid type which is either
    * a valid symbol which exists in Chado or
    * instantiated in the current record.
* no line within the value may begin with either '! G' or '!c G'
followed by one or two digits, followed by zero or one lower-case
letter, followed by a dot character.

[G14a]

### Comments:

Occasionally legitimate occurrences of text appearing between two @
characters will be incorrectly reported as an error.  An example of
such a false positive report would be when the value contains two or
more email addresses.

The second restriction imposed above is to remove any ambiguity as to
where the comments end and a subsequent proforma field begins.
