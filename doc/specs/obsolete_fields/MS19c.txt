### Status:

Turns out that current parsing of this field in the proforma parsing software is broken, and it makes a record bounce if filled in.  From DOC-117 its not clear whether this field is still needed, so for now, kept checks in place, but in addition, Peeves prints a warning message if the field is filled in saying that it must not be used.

doc reflects what is implementeed

Not yet implemented

* MS19c must be filled in for MS16 of type engineered_transposable_element
