## ! G25.  Relationship to clone                         [SoftCV] *s :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes

### !c Applicable:

Yes if G1a contains valid data and G1g contains 'y', otherwise no.

### Inclusion essential:

No.

### Mandatorially has value:

No.

### Checks:

To be valid, each value must either begin with

* Identified with: followed by a space character followed immediately by text which matches one of the following Perl regular expressions:
    * /^Nfly-[0-9]{3}$/ or
    * /^UUGC[0-9]{4}$/ or
    * /^ESG01[0-9]{1,2}[a-d]\.(B7|B21|E7|E21|TE)(\.[1-5])?_[A-H][0-9]{2}$/ or
    * /^bs[0-9]{2}[a-h][0-9]{2}$/ or
    * /^(AA|AF|AI|EK)[0-9]{6}$/ or
    * /^(AM|AT|CK|EC|EN|EP|FI|GH|GM|HL|IP|LP|LD|RE|RH|RT|SD|UT)[0-9]{5}$/
* or one of Maps to clone: and Does not map to clone: followed by a space character followed immediately by text which matches one of the following Perl regular expressions:
    * /^(BACH|BACN|BACR|CH221-|CH223-)[0-9]{2}[A-P][0-9]{2}$/ or 
    * /^DS0\d{4}$/ or
    * /^DY\d+$/ or
    * /^[RN]\d\d-\d\d$/

If !c is used:

* G1a must contain a valid value and G1g must contain 'y'
* the value(s) given in G25 must be different from the value(s)
stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in
G1a.

If !c is not used:

* if G1a contains a valid value and G1g contains 'y',
either:
    * the value(s) given in G25 must be identical to the
value(s) stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given
in G1a or
    * G25 must contain one or more valid values and no value is
stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in
G1a;
* if G1a does not contain a valid value or G1g does not
contain 'y', either:
    * G25 must be empty or
    * G25 must contain one or more valid values.

### Comments:

The regular expressions given match the great majority of legitimate
clone names but not all.  Some values which match a regular expression
are invalid names for clones.  Inevitably, Peeves must be expected to
generate false positives and false negatives.  Nonetheless, experience
has shown that it almost always produces the correct output when
validating the G25 field
