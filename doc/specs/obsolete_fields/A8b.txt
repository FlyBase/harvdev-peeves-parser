## ! A8b.  Segments - cytological ranges of ends *B :

### Multiple values allowed:

n - **see explanation below**

### !c Applicable:

y - although not sure how that would work in practice

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Checks:

- each segment is given after the fields starting "1: " "2: " etc.,
note, if there are more than 3 segments, the curator can add lines,
e.g.:

4: 
5: 


- the allowed values in this field depend on what is in A8a.

The basic form is:

$variable1;$variable2

- $variable1 and $variable2 can be any of the telomeres listed in <!--
Cytological bands, subdivisions, divisions, heterochromatin, telomeres,
centromeres -->

(they may have to split out into own subsection in derived field to
make it easy to which of many bands is telomere):

YLt
YSt
1Lt
1Rt
2Lt
2Rt
3Lt
3Rt
4Lt
4Rt

- $variable1 and $variable2 can also be bk$n, where $n is any integer
from 1, up to and including the number of breaks filled in in A8a.

### Comments:

if this field is filled in, then it can be used to calculate
the order of segments in the rearranged chromosome, together with the
information in A11.
This document does not discuss what should happen with this data -
these fields are rarely used and what we should do with them when they
are remains an open question .....
