### Inclusion essential:

No.

### Mandatorially has value:

No.

### Checks:

To be valid, each value must be symbol of type FBab, FBba or FBti and either

* a valid symbol which exists in Chado or
* instantiated in the current record.

If !c is used:

* G1a must contain a valid value and G1g must contain 'y'
* the value(s) given in G17t must be different from the value(s) stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a.

If !c is not used:

* if G1a contains a valid value and G1g contains 'y',
either:
    * the value(s) given in G17t must be identical to the value(s) stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a or
    * G17t must contain one or more valid values and no value is stored in Chado for the gene specified by the value given in G1a;
* if G1a does not contain a valid value or G1g does not contain 'y', either:
