### Checks:

The value may consist of an arbitrary amount of text, including layout
such as multiple lines and paragraphs, subject to the following
restriction:

* no line within the value may begin with either '! P' or '!c P'
followed by one or two digits, followed by zero or one lower-case
letter, followed by a dot character.

If !c is used:

* P22 must contain a valid value and
* the value given in P23 must be different from the value stored
in Chado for the publication specified by the P22 value and
* the publication type stored in Chado for the publication specified
by the P22 value must be 'personal communication to FlyBase'.

If !c is not used and P23 contains a value:

* if P22 contains a valid value:
    * the value given in P23 must be identical to the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the P22 value
and
   * the publication type stored in Chado for the publication
specified by the P22 value must be 'personal communication to
FlyBase';
* if P22 does not contain a value, P1 must contain
  'personal communication to FlyBase'.

Check done after the whole proforma has been parsed:

If it is a new personal communication, checks that at least one of P18 and P23 are filled in.

### Comments:

The restriction on the starts of lines within the value imposed above
is to remove any ambiguity as to where the text of a personal
communication ends and a subsequent proforma field begins.
