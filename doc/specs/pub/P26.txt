* Any value must consist of 8 digits (not starting with a leading zero), else a warning is issued


* If !c is used:

  * P22 must contain a valid value
  * the value given in P26 must be different from the value stored in Chado for the publication specified by the value given in P22.

If !c is not used:

* if P22 contains a valid value, either:
    * the value given in P26 must be identical to the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the value given in
P22 or
    * P26 must contain a valid value and no value is stored in
Chado for the publication specified by the value given in P22;


The following is implemented as a check after the whole proforma has been parsed:

- if it is a new publication and the publication type is a 'regular' publication (so *not* one of the 'not_regular_pub' types stored in symtab.pl) but isn't a 'supplementary material', P26 must be filled in.

### Comments:

A PubMed_ID is often called a 'PMID' (from a field name used in the
PubMed database) or 'MEDLINE_ID' (from the name of an earlier
database now incorporated into PubMed).
