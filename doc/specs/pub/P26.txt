## ! P26.  PubMed ID                *M :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.

### !c Applicable:

Yes if P22 contains valid data, otherwise no.

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:


Checks within field (validate_P26)

* Any value must consist of 8 digits (not starting with a leading zero), else a warning is issued


Checks against data in chado:

* a warning is given if try to !c the PubMed ID for a new publication


* check_changes_with_chado subroutine:

   - If it is an existing publication (P22 contains a valid value), the check_changes_with_chado subroutine is used to see whether the value in the field is the same as that already stored in Chado *for that FBrf*, and gives a warning if this is not consistent with the use (or not) of !c. This subroutine only compares the data that is already stored in Chado *for that FBrf* so another check is required to check that the PubMed ID is not already under another publication (see check_pub_accession_against_chado below).

* check_pub_accession_against_chado subroutine:

  - checks whether the PubMed ID in P26 is already in chado:

    - for new publications, warn that are trying to add an accession already in chado to a new publication
    - for existing publications, check that the FBrf the accession is associated with in chado is the same as the FBrf in P22 and warn if not.

- if it is a new publication and the publication type is a 'regular' publication (so *not* one of the 'not_regular_pub' types stored in symtab.pl) but isn't a 'supplementary material', P26 must be filled in.

### Comments:

A PubMed_ID is often called a 'PMID' (from a field name used in the
PubMed database) or 'MEDLINE_ID' (from the name of an earlier
database now incorporated into PubMed).
