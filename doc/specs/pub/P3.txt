### Comments:

In the case where the 'Journal' is an edited book with individually
contributed chapters use the chapter number in this field.
For publications whose dates are given as a range the syntax should be
n1/n2 where n1 and n2 are the years, i.e. 1951/1952. 
  
The value is essentially uncheckable other than for consistency with
data held in Chado.
