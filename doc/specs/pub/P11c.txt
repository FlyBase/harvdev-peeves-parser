## ! P11c. Sequence accession number       :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.

### !c Applicable:

Yes if P22 contains a valid FBrf, otherwise no.

### Inclusion of field essential for proforma checks:

No.

### Field mandatorially has value:

Yes if :

* P22 is 'new' and
* P1 contains either
   * DNA/RNA sequence record
   * protein sequence record

No otherwise.

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Allowed values:  



### Checks:

To be valid:  
  
* if P1 contains 'DNA/RNA sequence record', any value in P11c
must match [GenBank's specification (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html#AccessionB).
  
* if P1 contains 'protein sequence record', any value in P11c
must match UniProt's specification (see http://www.uniprot.org/manual/accession_numbers).
  
If P11c contains a value:
  
* if P22 is 'new', and P1 contains either
'DNA/RNA sequence record' or 'protein sequence record'.

* if P22 contains a valid FBrf, and the publication type stored in
Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in P22
contains either 'DNA/RNA sequence record' or 'protein sequence
record'.
  
If !c is used:

* P22 must contain a valid FBrf and
* the value given in P11c must be different from the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22.

If !c is not used:

* if P22 contains a valid FBrf, either:
    * the value given in P11c must be identical to the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22 or
    * P11c must contain a valid value and no value is stored in
Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in P22;
* if P22 is 'new', either:
    * P11c must be empty or
    * P11c must a contain valid value.
* if P22 is 'unattributed':
    * P11c must be empty.

### Error messages:  
  
If P22 is 'unattributed':  
P11b: Cannot contain data when P22 is 'unattributed'.  
 
If P22 is 'new':  
P11b: Cannot change the URL of a new publication!  
 
If pling-c and P11b is empty:
P11b: Not allowed to delete the URL.

If pling-c and P11b is a URL and there is nothing in chado:
P11b: Not allowed to delete the URL.

If P11b data is empty and so are the other P11 fields:  
None of P11a through P11d have any data.  

If P11a is not empty:  
P11b: Must not have data (<data>) when P11a has data (<moredata>).  

If P11c is not empty:  
P11b: Must not have data (<data>) when P11c has data (<moredata>).  
  
If pling-c and existing URL retrieved from chado via FBrf:  
P11b:  Trying to change the URL to '<your-URL>' but the URL isn't yet in Chado.  
P11b:  Trying to change the URL to the value (<your-URL>) it already has in Chado.  
P11b:  Trying to set URL to '<your-URL>' but it is '<chado-URL>' in Chado.

If you are curating a new publication of type 'DNA/RNA sequence record'  
or 'protein sequence record' fill in the accession number here.  
  
If you fill this field in, you should not fill anything in in P11a. or  
P11c.
