Unusually for a publication proforma field, if !c is not used, any values given are added to those which may already be present in Chado.

### Status:

doc reflects what is implemented.

Not implemented yet:

* if !c is used, does not check the data in P30 against what is already in chado (ie. does not check that the values in P30 are be different from the value(s) stored in Chado for the publication specified by the value given in P22.)
