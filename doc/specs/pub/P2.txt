If P22 is unattributed:  
P2: Cannot contain data when P22 is 'unattributed'.  
  
If pling-c'd:  
P2: Can't change a multipub abbreviation without an FBrf in P22  
  
If pling-c'd and no multipub abbreviation given:  
P2:  Can't delete a multipub abbreviation  
  
If pling-c'd and a multipub (valid) abbreviation given:  
P2: Are you sure you want to change the multipub of FBrf0123456 in chado?  
  
If pling-c'd and the given valid multipub is the same as what is already in chado:  
P2: Cannot use !c here, as '<abbreviation-from-chado>' is already the multipub of FBrf0123456 in chado.  
  
If multipub abbreviation is blank:  
then if P22 is a valid FBrf:  
P2: Missing data --- perhaps you mean to put <abbreviation-from-chado>  
  
or if P22 is not a valid FBrf and multipub abbreviation is blank and pubtype (P1) is on the list given under comments:  
P2:  Missing data - must have a multipub abbreviation.  
 
If P22 is new, P2 is filled in erroneously and P1 contains eg paper ie something that needs a multipub abbreviation:  
P2:  'hello_not-Nature' is not a valid multipub abbreviation in Chado for pubtype 'paper'
