## ! P11a. Page range or article number        *z :

### Multiple values allowed:

No.

### !c Applicable:

Yes if P22 contains a valid FBrf,  
No otherwise.  
  
### Inclusion of field essential for proforma checks:

No.

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Field mandatorially has value:

Yes if P22 is 'new' and P1 contains either
'paper' or
'review' or  
see Comments,   
otherwise no.  

### Allowed values:  
  
-------------------------

<non-zero-digit> ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

<digit> ::= 0 | <non-zero-digit>

<integer> ::= <non-zero-digit> | <integer><digit>

<number> ::= <integer><roman-numeral>

<lower-case-letter> ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z

<upper-case-letter> ::= A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z

<letter> ::= <upper-case-letter> | <lower-case-letter>

<page> ::= <number> | <letter><integer>

<page-range> ::= <number> | <page>--<page>

-------------------------

### Checks:

To be valid, each value must be a <page-range> as defined by the
following BNF, where the term <roman-numeral> is intentionally
left undefined.

If a value contains two <page>s :

* if either <page> in <page-range> starts with a <letter>,
both must start with the same <letter> and
* the <number> or <integer> component of the first <page>
must be numerically smaller than that of the second.

If !c is used:  
  
* P22 must contain a valid FBrf and  
	* the value given in P4 must be different from the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22.

If !c is not used:  
  
* if P22 contains a valid value, either:
    * the value given in P11a must be identical to the value
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22 or
    * no value is stored in Chado for the publication specified by the
FBrf given in P22;
* if P22 is 'new':  
    * P11a may a contain valid value.  
* if P22 is 'unattributed':  
    * P11a must remain blank.

### Comments:

The page numbering schemes used in actual publications are far more
complex than the checks above would imply and false positives are
occasionally to be expected when Peeves checks valid data.  The checks
given above detect the great majority of errors encountered in
practice but generate only relatively few false positives.
