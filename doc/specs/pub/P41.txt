### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

# Checks done in validate_P41


Cross-checks with other fields:

* If !c is used in P41

   * P22 must contain a valid FBrf number (i.e. not 'new' or 'unattributed')
     
   * warns if there is no data already in chado (check only carried out if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge')



* P41 must be filled in, unless:

   * curation record is a bibliographic record
   * curation record is an edit record
   * curation record is an expression record

   * publication is a review
   * publication is a 'FlyBase analysis' record

   * there is already flag data in chado (extra check only carried out if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge')


Checks within the field (in validate_triage_flags)

* If P41 contains data
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data (check done in check_for_duplicated_lines)
   * warns if there are any duplicated values (check done in check_for_duplicated_lines)
   * each value must correspond to one of the currently allowed flags (see the list of 'P41_flag' entries in symtab.pl for the list of currently allowed values) or its equivalent '::DONE' flag.


   * if 'no_flag' is given, no other values may be given in the proforma

   * extra checks carried out if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge':

       * if 'no_flag' is given and there is no !c, warns if different flags already exist in chado for the FBrf

       * if 'no_flag' already exists in chado for the FBrf, warns if P41 is filled in (with something other than just 'nocur') if !c is not being used


* If P41 is empty

  * if there is a !c
     * warn that you cannot !c this field to nothing (if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge' this warning is only printed if there is flag data in chado, otherwise a warning that you cannot !c a field that does not have data in chado is printed).

  * if there is no !c
     * warns that this field cannot be empty (and if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge' takes into account any data in chado, so will not print an error if the field is empty but there is already data in chado)


# Checks done in crosscheck_P41_P43_P44

This cross-check is only run if the publication is a regular type of publication (is *not* listed in 'not_regular_pub' in symtab.pl) and is not a review.  It is not run if the type of publication is '.bibl'

* If P41 contains 'disease' or 'diseaseHP' and P43 contains 'noDOcur' a warning is issued (as one of these must be wrong)  

* If P41 contains 'disease' or 'diseaseHP' (or the equivalent ::DONE flags)
   * If Peeves is running in Cambridge, P43 field or equivalent location in chado must contain data (NOTE: P43 can include 'noDOcur' as in some cases there may be disease data to capture for Harvard but not for Cambridge)
   * If Peeves is running elsewhere, P43 field must also contain data if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record
   * P44 field must contain data if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record

* If P43 contains data (excluding noDOcur)
   * If Peeves is running in Cambridge, P41 field or equivalent location in chado must contain 'disease' or 'diseaseHP' (or the equivalent ::DONE flags)
   * If Peeves is running elsewhere, P41 field must contain 'disease' or 'diseaseHP' (or the equivalent ::DONE flags) if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record
   * P44 field must contain data if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record

* If P44 contains data
   * P41 field must also contain 'disease' or 'diseaseHP' (or the equivalent ::DONE flags) if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record
   * P43 field must also contain data if the record is a 'skim or 'user' record

### Status:

doc: checked and changed doc so that it reflects what has been implemented

Known issue: if you !c to nothing for "unattributed" this does not generate an error message.  This is because the 'unattributed' subroutine (which kicks in before validate_P41) is only reporting an error if you try to !c data to a value.  If P22 is unattributed, the unattributed subroutine runs and it never gets to validate_P43 because its an either/or, so I can't see an easy way to code something in to catch this.  A record submitted in error like this would bounce with Kathleen, so its a pretty harmless bug.

At the moment, Peeves only uses existing flag data in chado if it is running in Cambridge (as it uses a support scripts module to get the flag info from the database).  Should add the relevant sql query directly to Peeves so that this more sophisticated checking can be done everywhere.
