### Comments:

A title enclosed within square brackets is either an English translation of
the publication's non-English title or the string '[title not yet available]'.
Foreign titles are entered  along with its English translation.  If
only the translation is available, enclose it in [].  If a foreign
title and translation are both available, put the foreign title first,
followed by the translation in [].
In the case that the publication is a book, authored (as opposed to
edited) throughout by the same person or people, then enter the title
of the book here. 
Titles should always end with a full stop.
