### Checks:


Checks within field:

Syntax checks on DOI number:

* The DOI number must not be prefixed with a 'doi:' or 'doi ' style string.

* The DOI number must match the basic 'doi_prefix/doi_suffix' style format.

* The doi_prefix part must match the expected format (dd.dd, dd.dd.dd etc) e.g. 10.1234, 10.1234.555.

* If the doi_prefix part does not start with '10' a warning is printed as this is unusual.

* The doi_suffix part must not end with a '.'

* The doi_suffix part must not contain a space.

(syntax rules made using information in https://www.doi.org/doi-handbook/HTML/index.html - the rules for the doi_suffix part could probably be made tighter still).


Checks against data in chado:

* a warning is given if try to !c the DOI for a new publication

* a warning is given if try to delete the DOI of an existing publication (using !c to nothing).

* check_changes_with_chado subroutine:

   - If it is an existing publication (P22 contains a valid value), the check_changes_with_chado subroutine is used to see whether the value in the field is the same as that already stored in Chado *for that FBrf*, and gives a warning if this is not consistent with the use (or not) of !c. This subroutine only compares the data that is already stored in Chado *for that FBrf* so another check is required to check that the DOI is not already under another publication (see check_pub_accession_against_chado below).

* check_pub_accession_against_chado subroutine:

  - checks whether the DOI in P11d is already in chado:

    - for new publications, warn that are trying to add an accession already in chado to a new publication
    - for existing publications, check that the FBrf the accession is associated with in chado is the same as the FBrf in P22 and warn if not.


* if it is a new publication and the publication type is a 'regular' publication (so *not* one of the 'not_regular_pub' types stored in symtab.pl) but isn't a 'supplementary material', P11d must be filled in.

* if P22 is 'unattributed' P11d must be blank.
