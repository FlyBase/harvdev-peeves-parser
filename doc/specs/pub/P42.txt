# Checks done in validate_P42

Cross-checks with other fields (in validate_triage_flags)

* If !c is used in P42

   * P22 must contain a valid FBrf number (i.e. not 'new' or 'unattributed')

   * warns if there is no data already in chado (check only carried out if 'Where_running' is 'Cambridge')



Checks within the field

* If P42 contains data
   * warns if there is a blank line within the data (check done in check_for_duplicated_lines)
   * warns if there are any duplicated values (check done in check_for_duplicated_lines)
   * each value must correspond to one of the currently allowed flags (see the list of 'P42_flag' entries in symtab.pl for the list of currently allowed values) or its equivalent '::DONE' flag.

### Status:

doc: checked and changed doc so that it reflects what has been implemented

Known issue: if you !c to nothing for "unattributed" this does not generate an error message.  This is because the 'unattributed' subroutine (which kicks in before validate_P42) is only reporting an error if you try to !c data to a value.  If P22 is unattributed, the unattributed subroutine runs and it never gets to validate_P43 because its an either/or, so I can't see an easy way to code something in to catch this.  A record submitted in error like this would bounce with Kathleen, so its a pretty harmless bug.
