### Checks:

A valid value consists of an arbitrary string of characters, followed by
a TAB character, followed either by the string '?.' or an arbitrary
number of repetitions of two-character strings each consisting of an
uppercase Roman letter followed by a dot (aka full-stop, aka period).

The string before the TAB character denotes the author's family name.
Although it is not strictly illegal for the family name to contain
dot-characters, Peeves must generate a warning message in this case.

The string after the TAB character is the list of initials of the given
names of that author.  If no initial is available for the author, the
string '?.' must be used.

If !c is used:  

* P22 must contain a valid FBrf and
* the value(s) given in P12 must be different from the value(s)
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the value given in
P22.

If !c is not used:

* if P22 contains a valid FBrf, either:
    * the value(s) given in P12 must be identical to the
value(s) stored in Chado for the publication specified by the value given
in P22 or
    * P12 must contain one or more valid values and no value is
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22;
* if P22 does not contain a valid FBrf:
    * P12 must contain one or more valid values.
* if P22 is 'unattributed':
    * P12 must be left blank.
    
### Error messages:

If P22 is 'unattributed':

If authors are different in chado:  
P12: Trying to set list of authors to %s but it is <authors list> in Chado.  
  
If P22 is 'new' and no authors (accidental omission):

P12: Old style data in 'P12 content'.  Please use "Field	H.I."  
P12: Must not omit author's initials. Use "Field	." if they are unknown.  
P12: Unrecognized format for author 'P12 content'. Try checking whitespace and/or initials.  
  
Existing authors missing:  
P12: Looking for the existing list of authors for %s but that information isn't yet in Chado   
		Chado should always have this data, so you've found a serious bug.

### Comments:

An author need not be a known human individual.  Examples include
corporate persons and Anonymous.

The Peeves warning when the family name contains a dot-character is to
pick up the common error of reversing the order of family name and
initials.  A family name may legitimately contain a dot-character,
especially if it is a corporate person named by an abbreviation such
as "N.A.S.A." though in practice the dots are frequently omitted for
such cases.
