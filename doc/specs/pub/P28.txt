### Multiple values allowed:

No - Implemented (using 'single_line' in validate_P28)


### !c Applicable:

Yes - Implemented (in validate_P28)

### Inclusion essential:

No - Implemented

### Mandatorially has value:

No - Implemented (in validate_P28)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field: (in validate_P28):

- value in field must match the format PMC[0-9]{7,} i.e. PMC plus at least 7 digits, otherwise an error message is generated.

Checks against data in chado:

* a warning is given if try to !c the PMCID for a new publication


* check_changes_with_chado subroutine:

   - If it is an existing publication (P22 contains a valid value), the check_changes_with_chado subroutine is used to see whether the value in the field is the same as that already stored in Chado *for that FBrf*, and gives a warning if this is not consistent with the use (or not) of !c. This subroutine only compares the data that is already stored in Chado *for that FBrf* so another check is required to check that the PMCID is not already under another publication (see check_pub_accession_against_chado below).

* check_pub_accession_against_chado subroutine:

  - checks whether the PMCID in P28 is already in chado:

    - for new publications, warn that are trying to add an accession already in chado to a new publication
    - for existing publications, check that the FBrf the accession is associated with in chado is the same as the FBrf in P22 and warn if not.


Cross-checks with other fields

* if 'P22' contains 'unattributed', P28 must NOT be filled in.

* if value in P1 is 'supplementary material', P28 must NOT be filled in.
