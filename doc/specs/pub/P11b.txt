### Checks:

If value(s) is/are given each must satisfy the specification of a URI
as given in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt, with the further restriction that the
only permissible schemes are 'http', 'https', and 'ftp'.

No values may be duplicated.

Peeves must issue a warning if more than one value is given.

If !c is used:  

* P22 must contain a valid FBrf and
* the value(s) given in P11d must be different from the value(s)
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22.

If !c is not used:

* if P22 contains a valid value, either:
    * the value(s) given in P11d must be identical to the
value(s) stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given
in P22 or
    * P11d must contain one or more valid values and no value is
stored in Chado for the publication specified by the FBrf given in
P22;
* if P22 is 'new', either:
    * P11d must be empty or
    * P11d must contain one or more valid values.
* if P22 is 'unattributed':
    * P11d must remain blank.

### Error messages:  
  
If P22 is 'unattributed':  
P11b: Cannot contain data when P22 is 'unattributed'.  
 
If P22 is 'new':  
P11b: Cannot change the URL of a new publication!  
 
If pling-c and P11b is empty:
P11b: Not allowed to delete the URL.

If pling-c and P11b is a URL and there is nothing in chado:
P11b: Not allowed to delete the URL.

If P11b data is empty and so are the other P11 fields:  
None of P11a through P11d have any data.  

If P11a is not empty:  
P11b: Must not have data (<data>) when P11a has data (<moredata>).  

If P11c is not empty:  
P11b: Must not have data (<data>) when P11c has data (<moredata>).  
  
If pling-c and existing URL retrieved from chado via FBrf:  
P11b:  Trying to change the URL to '<your-URL>' but the URL isn't yet in Chado.  
P11b:  Trying to change the URL to the value (<your-URL>) it already has in Chado.  
P11b:  Trying to set URL to '<your-URL>' but it is '<chado-URL>' in Chado.  

### Related fields:

[P11d][P11d].

### Comments:

The term "URL", or "Uniform Resource Locator" is a special case of
"URI" or "Uniform Resource Identifier".

Although it is legal for a publication to have more than one URL, for
example if several mirror sites exist or if supplementary material
consists of several objects, this is sufficiently unusual for a
warning to be desirable.

Most commonly used in literature curation for publications of type
"supplementary material" - but use this field as a last resort, where
possible use the P11d. DOI field instead.

A check involving P11a/b/c/d is performed (see Error messages).
