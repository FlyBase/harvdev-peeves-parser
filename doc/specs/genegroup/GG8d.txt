##  ! GG8d. Action - dissociate the accession specified in GG8a/GG8b from the gene group specified in GG1h/GG1a? (blank/y) : 

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GG8a -> GG8b, GG8c, GG8d


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* if GG8d is filled in, 'check_single_allowed_value' subroutine checks that the only allowed value is 'y'

Checks between fields:

* If GG8d is filled in, GG8a must be filled in

* If GG8d is filled in, GG8b must be filled in

* Since GG8d is a 'correction of existing data' field, it must not be filled in for:
  * a completely new dataset
  * a dataset merge (suspect using GG8d for a merge is not allowed since a merge involves making a new FBid, but need to check this with Kathleen ??)

### Comments:

Curation manual says 'Single OK. Multiple untested.' for the 'Multiple values allowed' section, but have implemented it as a single line field as the only allowed value is 'y'


### Status:

If GG8d is filled in, no checks are done to make sure that the accession (specified in GG8a and GG8b) is actually associated with the dataset (specified by GG1a) in chado.
