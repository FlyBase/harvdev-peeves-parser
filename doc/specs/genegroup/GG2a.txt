## ! GG2a. Action - gene group name to use in FlyBase      *e :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field

  * checks done in validate_new_full_name

    * sub 'check_allowed_characters' makes sure the symbol only contains characters from an allowed set (see %mapping_table at the top of check_allowed_characters in tools.pl for current list of allowed characters)

    * check that any greek symbols are not malformed

Cross-checks between fields:

* If GG2a and GG2c are both filled in, the value must not be the same (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'not same')

* If GG1f is filled in, GG2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent') (checked using proformae in records2test/GG2 - works for both unhashed and hashed proformae)

* If GG2c is filled in, GG2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

* GG2a must be filled in for new gene groups (sub check_filled_in_for_new_feature, test = 'yes')
