## ! GG4.  Type of gene group [CV]  *t :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (but see cross-checks with other fields below)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* validate_cvterm_field checks that the term is a valid CV term from of the correct type (from namespace 'group_descriptor')

Cross-checks between fields

* GG4 must be filled in for a brand new gene group.

* for an existing gene group (including a gene group being renamed):

   * if GG4 is filled in, it must be a plingc (since only one value is allowed in the database for this field).

   * if GG4 is plingc-ed, it must be filled in (since each gene group *must* have this field filled in in the database).

### Comments:

Note: Gene group merging has not been implemented yet in the parser (and the GG1f merge field has been removed from the master proforma). To be ready in case gene group merging is ever implemented in proforma (and to prevent any GG4 errors being missed in that case), cross-checks for GG4 for gene group merges have been set up in Peeves the same way as for brand new gene groups, as I think that this would be the desired behaviour if gene group merging is implemented.
