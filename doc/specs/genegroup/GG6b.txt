### Status:

Not yet implemented:

* If GG1g=n, then GG6b will normally be filled in.
[May be able to use check_filled_in_for_new_feature for this - has a test of 'advised' already, but that might need tweaking, as at the moment the 'advised' style text is only used if the style of the proforma is opposite to that of the curator - so need to check that removing site-specific checking wouldn't break what is currently implemented (looks ok)]
