## ! GG14. Corresponding GO-CAM identifier :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (implemented).

### !c Applicable:

No (implemented).

NOTE: !c functionality for this field has not yet been implemented in the perl parser (20241003) so Peeves is also currently set to not allow !c for this field.

### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented).

### Mandatorially has value:

No (implemented).


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented).


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub check_accession_characters does two checks:

  * uses 'check_allowed_characters' to warn if the GO-CAM identifier contains character(s) that are not in the expect4ed character set.

  * warns if the GO-CAM identifier starts with '3A' (as it is easy to add this string by mistake when copying the identifier from the source).


Checks between fields:

* If GG14 is filled in, checks that the FBrf is the expected FB analysis reference (FBrf0225556) and issues a warning if not.

### Comments:

gm241007: I based the 'check_allowed_characters' character set on the current list of models at github geneontology/noctua-models/tree/master/models, but if this check generates false-positives, the character set allowed for the GG14 field can easily be expanded.

### Status:
