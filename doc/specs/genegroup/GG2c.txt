## ! GG2c. Action - rename this gene group name        :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Cross-checks with other fields:

* If GG2a and GG2c are both filled in, the value must not be the same

*  'compare_field_pairs': If GG1f is filled in, GG2c must NOT be filled in (checked using proformae in records2test/GG2 - works for both unhashed and hashed proformae)

* If GG2c is filled in, GG2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

* sub cross_check_full_name_rename checks that the value in GG2c matches the fullname in chado of the subject of the proforma ie. the symbol in the symbol rename field (if both the symbol and fullname are being renamed) or the symbol in the primary symbol field (if only the fullname is being renamed).

* GG2c and GG1f must not both be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')

### Status:

Not implemented any of the following:


Cross-checks with other fields:

  * checks done after parsing entire proforma
    * if GG1e contains data, print an error message if GG2a is filled in without GG2c being filled in

    * if GG1e contains data, print an error message if GG2c is filled in without GG2a being filled in

    * if GG1e contains data, print the following if neither GG2a nor GG2c are filled in:

"Neither GG2a nor GG2c are filled in, but GG1e is:
 G1e.  Action - rename this gene symbol                       :<symbol>
This is only allowed if you are trying to rename a gene's symbol without changing the full name"
    

    * If neither GG1f or GG1e are filled in, and GG2c is empty, then GG2a may only be filled in when GG1g is 'n', otherwise it prints the warning "You have filled in GG2a. for an existing gene '<symbol>', did you mean to put it in GG2b."

    * If neither GG1f or GG1e are filled in, and GG2c is filled in, then GG2a must be filled in
