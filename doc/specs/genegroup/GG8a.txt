## ! GG8a. Orthologous gene group accession (rpt. sect. for mult.)  *O :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented) NOTE: this may need to change to Yes - there is a question in the original specs about whether or not this field can be !c'd, but have implemented No for now.


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): GG8a -> GG8b, GG8c, GG8d


### Checks:

Checks within field:

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GG8a is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

Checks between fields (for each duplication of the GG8a-GG8c unit):

 * GG8a must be filled in if any of GG8[bc] are filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
 
 * If GG8d is filled in, GG8a must be filled in

### Comments:



### Status:

Not yet implemented:

checks within field on format of accession - will add field-specific check if convert check_allowed_characters to process_field_data format, or when write a subroutine to do better checking of accession formatting based on type of accession in field.
