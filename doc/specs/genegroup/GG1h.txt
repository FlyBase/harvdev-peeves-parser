## ! GG1h. FlyBase gene group ID (FBgg)  *z :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (implemented in validate_GG1h)

### !c Applicable:

No (implemented in validate_GG1h)


### Inclusion essential:

No (implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
Implemented (in validate_GG1h)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Within validate_GG1h:

* 'FBid_list_check' subroutine checks basic format of value given i.e. it must be an FBid of the expected type (i.e FBgg[0-9]{7})

* If this field is filled in in a non-user record, issue a warning as curators don't normally fill this field in.??Note, this was copied from G1h checks, should revisit code and probably change the user check??

### Status:

See DC-585 for issues I had with getting cross_check_1a_1g to work.
Similar to the situation for cross_check_1a_1g (see DC-585), I had to remove the prototyping in cross_check_FBid_symbol to work for GG1h.

ought to be able to use cross_check_FBid_symbol:

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' subroutine does a lot of field cross-checking and validity checks of field values - see the gene/G1h.txt specs file for details.
