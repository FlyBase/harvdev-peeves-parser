### Status:

Only implemented basic checks, the following have not yet been implemented:

Within field checks:

- value must match the general format FBggID_pathway_thumb.svg and FBggID must be valid (may make sense to do the latter part during between field checks)

Between field checks:

- FBggID part of value must match that of the FBgg symbol in GG1a
