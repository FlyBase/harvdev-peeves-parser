Cross-checks between fields:

* If TO1g (merge field) is filled in, TO2c must not be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')

* If TO2c is filled in, TO2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

* If TO2c and TO2a are both filled in, they must not be the same value  (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'not same')
