### Checks:

Cross-checks within field:

* sub 'validate_existing_full_name'

Cross-checks between fields:

* If TO2c is filled in, TO2a must be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'dependent')

* If TO2c and TO2a are both filled in, they must not be the same value  (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'not same')

* If TO1g (merge field) is filled in, TO2c must not be filled in (compare_field_pairs, pair_test = 'single')

### Status:


Not yet implemented:

* there is no check that the value given in TO2c is really a valid fullname in chado. should make a generic subroutine that can be checked at the end of the proforma - currently this check against chado is only done in gene.pl in amongst all the complex cross-checks
