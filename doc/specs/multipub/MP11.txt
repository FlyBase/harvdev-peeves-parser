## ! MP11. Editor(s), if MP17 = book              *a-*b :

### Multiple values allowed:

Yes, each on a separate line.

### !c Applicable:

Yes if MP1 contains valid data, otherwise no.

### Inclusion essential:

No.

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes if the value given in MP3 is 'y' and MP17 contains 'book', otherwise no.

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

A valid value consists of an arbitrary string of characters, followed by
a TAB character, followed either by the string '?.' or an arbitrary
number of repetitions of two-character strings each consisting of an
uppercase Roman letter followed by a dot (aka full-stop, aka period).

The string before the TAB character denotes the editor's family name.
Although it is not strictly illegal for the family name to contain
dot-characters, Peeves must generate a warning message in this case.

The string after the TAB character is the list of initials of the given
names of that editor.  If no initial is available for the editor, the
string '?.' must be used.

If !c is used:  

* MP1 must contain a valid value and
* the value(s) given in MP11 must be different from the value(s)
stored in Chado for the multipub specified by the value given in
MP1.

If !c is not used:

* if MP1 contains a valid value, either:
    * the value(s) given in MP11 must be identical to the
value(s) stored in Chado for the multipub specified by the value given
in MP1 or
    * MP11 must contain one or more valid values and no value is
stored in Chado for the multipub specified by the value given in
MP1;
* if MP1 does not contain a valid value, either:
    * MP11 must be empty or
    * MP11 must contain one or more valid values.

### Comments:

An editor need not be a known human individual.  Examples include
corporate persons and Anonymous.

The Peeves warning when the family name contains a dot-character is to
pick up the common error of reversing the order of family name and
initials.  A family name may legitimately contain a dot-character,
especially if it is a corporate person named by an abbreviation such
as "N.A.S.A." though in practice the dots are frequently omitted for
such cases.
