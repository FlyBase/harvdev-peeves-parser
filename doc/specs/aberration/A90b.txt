## ! A90b.    Genomic location of breakpoint                       :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): A90a -> A90b, A90c, A90h, A90j


### Checks:

Checks within field

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90b is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).


* 'validate_sequence_location' checks that the general format of the sequence location is:

 	arm:x..y

	where:

	* 'arm' is a valid chromosomal arm (currently stored in symtab.pl)

	* '..y' is optional (ie. if the sequence location is a single value rather than a range)

    * for a range, y >= x (i.e. issue a warning if x > y)

Checks between fields:

  * A90a must be filled in if A90b is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs) 
  * A90b must be filled in if A90c is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
