## ! A8a.  Breaks - cytological or progenitor break ranges  *B :

### Multiple values allowed:



### !c Applicable:

Ought to be, but has not been implemented (see DC-398)

### Inclusion essential:

No

### Mandatorially has value:

No

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

- each breakpoint is given after the fields starting "1: " "2: " etc.,
- each breakpoint must be in the following normal cytological format (similar to G10a.):

CHECKS: Values should correspond to known cytological locations which
are listed in camgenes.xml section headed <!-- Cytological bands,
subdivisions, divisions, heterochromatin, telomeres, centromeres --> a
lookup file could be generated.  Each statement must either be a known
cytological location or a range between two known cytological locations
separated by a -.

NB NB NB as well as the above, a break can be given as an FBti symbol,
in which case it must already exists as a valid FBti symbol or it must
be made so in this curation record

NB NB NB as well as the above, a break can be given as [] NB NB NB
these should stay as square brackets and not be turned into
superscripts on parsing.

### Comments:

NB NB NB As described in curation_manual we used to use the "PROGENITOR
BREAKS" system - if we still need to be able to do this  - will have to be
built into the chado loading specification and Peeves checking (no idea whether this was implemented in chado proforma parsing ?)

### Updated:

gm131202 (doc for this field moved here from aberration.checks.pro with some tweaking).
gm151001 (added Dupl. for multiple field info).
