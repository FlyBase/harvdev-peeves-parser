## ! A1h. FlyBase aberration ID (FBab) *z :

### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (using 'single_line' subroutine)

### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented

### Inclusion essential:

Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
Not Implemented (if we really want the rule above)

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes if the record is of type user, otherwise no.
Implemented (in validate_A1h)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Within validate_A1h:

* 'FBid_list_check' subroutine checks basic format of value given i.e. it must be an FBid of the expected type (i.e FBab[0-9]{7})  (note that this subroutine allows the value 'new' in addition to FBid format, so an additional check is also performed in 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' to prevent 'new' in this field - not worked out the details yet)

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' checks that the value in A1h must exist in Chado as a valid FBid (uniquename) (there is no check for correct 'type' of uniquename here, that is done in the basic 'FBid_list_check' format check described above).


* If this field is filled in, issue a warning unless it is a user record or a Harvard curator record.

Cross-checks with other fields:

* 'cross_check_FBid_symbol' subroutine does a lot of field cross-checking and validity checks of field values - see the gene/G1h.txt specs file for details.
