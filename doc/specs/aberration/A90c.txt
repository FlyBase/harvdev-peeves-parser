## ! A90c.    Genome release number for entry in A90a              :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented)

### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): A90a -> A90b, A90c, A90h, A90j


### Checks:

checks within field

 * sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if GA90c is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).


* must be the number of the current genome release (stored in symtab.pl).

Checks between fields:

  * A90a must be filled in if A90c is filled in (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs) 

* if A90b is filled in, A90c must be filled in

   * the only exception is if A90b is being !c-ed to nothing (ie. removing sequence location) - in this specific case A90c should be blank.

      * if A90c is filled in when A90b is !c to nothing, a message is printed so that the curator can double-check whether they were trying to !c A90b to nothing, or failed to fill in the corrected sequence location in A90b by mistake.

* if A90c is filled in, A90b must be filled in
