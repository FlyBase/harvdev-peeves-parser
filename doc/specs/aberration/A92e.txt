### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)

### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented) (see below)


### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): A92a -> A92b, A92c, A92d, A92e


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if A92e is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that the value is either 'y' or 'n' (only 'y or n' terms are allowed).  Using this subroutine instead of 'check_y_or_n' subroutine because need to go through process_field_data to store values for checks between fields.

Checks between fields:


 * A92a must be filled in if A92e is filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

 * A92d must be filled in if A92e is filled in (and vice versa) AND they must not contain the same value (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
