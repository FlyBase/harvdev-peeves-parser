## ! A92c.    Cytological location of right end of segment                :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): A92a -> A92b, A92c, A92d, A92e


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if A92c is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that the value is a valid cytological band.  Using this subroutine instead of 'validate_cytological_location' because A92c should contain just a single cytological band NOT a range (which is what validate_cytological_location checks).

Checks between fields:


 * A92a must be filled in if A92c is filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)

### Comments:



### Status:

* This field should only be filled in for Dmel alleles ??

* cytological band in A92c should be higher than value in A92b (original specs in DC-215 implied that A92b and A92c cannot have the same value, but have found examples that do, presumably where only a single cytological band is deleted).
