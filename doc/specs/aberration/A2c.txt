### Status:

doc: checked that doc reflects what has been implemented

Not implemented:

* similar to G2c, there is no check that the value given in A2c is really a valid fullname in chado.

* there is no cross-check of A2a with A2c - need to add something that takes into account whether or not the allele is new (A1g) and whether or not rename/merge fields (A1e/A1f) are filled in. [gm131211]
