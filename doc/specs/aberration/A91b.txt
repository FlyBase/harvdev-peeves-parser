## ! A91b.    Cytological location of left end of segment              :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented)


### !c Applicable:

Yes (Implemented)


### Inclusion essential:

No (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

No (Implemented)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

Yes (Implemented): A91a -> A91b, A91c, A91d, A91e


### Checks:

Checks within field:

* sub 'no_hashes_in_proforma'- checks that there are no hashes in the entire proforma if A91b is filled in (this is to make it easier to implement checking of fields that can be duplicated).

* sub 'validate_cvterm_field' checks that the value is a valid cytological band.  Using this subroutine instead of 'validate_cytological_location' because A91b should contain just a single cytological band NOT a range (which is what validate_cytological_location checks).

Checks between fields:

 * A91a must be filled in if A91b is filled in (and vice versa) (sub compare_duplicated_field_pairs)
