### Status:

NB: parsing of this field has not been implemented, so although all the Peeves checks listed above are in place, in addition, a warning message is printed if this field is filled in to alert the curators that the record cannot be loaded.

Not yet implemented:

* all other proforma fields must be blank.

* the value in the primary symbol filed must already be in chado
