### Status:

I think I got the TC5d/TC5c dependency right - it looks as though TC5d is not compulsory if TC5c is filled in (so I think TC5c can be filled in without filling in TC5d).

Implemented '!c Applicable' as no as from the parsing code it looks like this is a dependent field on TC5c, so I guess that !c-ing the TC5c field should update the TC5d field
