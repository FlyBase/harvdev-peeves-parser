### Multiple values allowed:

No
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field)


### !c Applicable:

No
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field)

### Inclusion essential:

Yes (Implemented)


### Mandatorially has value:

Yes
Implemented (in validate_primary_FBid_field - checks both for whether the entire field is empty, and also whether individual values in a hashed list are empty)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (Implemented)


### Checks:

Checks within field:

in 'validate_primary_FBid_field':

* each entry must either be the string 'new' or an FBid number of the type expected for the proforma (ie. FBtc)

* if the entry is an FBtc number, it must be valid in chado.



Cross-checks with other fields:

in 'validate_primary_FBid_field':

* The number of entries in the list in TC1f must match the number of entries in the TC1a field


Cross-checks done after parsing the entire proforma:

* sub 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details.

* TC1j must only be filled in for brand new cell lines (sub check_filled_in_for_new_feature)

* If TC1j is filled in, the symbol in TC1a must not be a valid cell-line symbol *in chado* (because TC1j is only supposed to be filled in the first time a cell-line entry goes into the database - I think)
