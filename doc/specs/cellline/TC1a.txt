## ! TC1a. Cell line symbol to use in database  :

### Multiple values allowed:

No (Implemented: 'single_line' subroutine in loop where the field is identified)

### !c Applicable:

No (Implemented: in validate_primary_proforma_field)

### Inclusion essential:

Yes (Implemented)

### Mandatorially has value:

Yes (Implemented: 'contains_data' subroutine in loop where the field is identified)

### Dupl. for multiple field:

No (implemented)

### Checks:

Checks within field:

Checks within validate_primary_proforma_field:

  *  sub validate_primary_proforma_field (see doc/specs/allele/GA1a.txt for details)

Cross-checks with other fields (done after parsing of entire proforma):

* sub 'cross_check_harv_style_symbol_rename_merge_fields' - see MA1f.txt for details (this includes a check that the symbol is either a valid FBtc symbol in chado or is newly generated in record (with other fields filled in as appropriate) as part of the cross-checks).

* TC1j must only be filled in for brand new cell lines (sub check_filled_in_for_new_feature)

* If TC1j is filled in, the symbol in TC1a must not be a valid cell-line symbol *in chado* (because TC1j is only supposed to be filled in the first time a cell-line entry goes into the database - I think)
