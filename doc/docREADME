README for svn/flybase-cam/Peeves/doc

Directory structure and description of items
=============================================


folders
-------

obsolete_doc:	folder containing doc that is no longer being maintained, but which it might be useful to keep at least in the short-term (will delete once all useful info moved to current doc files).

specs:			folder containing detailed specification of checks required for each proforma field.  Organised into sub-folders, one for each proforma. Each proforma field has its own file (named for the field) within the appropriate sub-folder (there are a few exceptions where it made more sense to have a single specification file covering more than one field).  Each file indicates whether or not it has been recently checked to see whether the specification has actually been implemented or not.



files
-----

docREADME:							this file
peeves_software_development.sop:	SOP for workflow of peeves software development
spec_template.txt:					template file for making a Peeves specification file for a proforma field
VERSION:							Version history (copy of each 'our $Peeves_version' line plus its associated comment since Peeves went live)
