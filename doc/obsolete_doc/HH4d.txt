### Status:


Not yet implemented:

Checks within field:

* must contain a 'GO CV term' - need to know the format - whether it is just 'GO term' or 'GO term ; GOid'


Checks between fields:

* HH4d should only be filled in 'health-related process' i.e. if 'HH1g' is 'health-related process' (or I guess need also to find out value from chado for existing FBhh entries)
