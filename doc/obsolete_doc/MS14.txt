Cross-checks done after parsing the entire proforma:


* 'check_filled_in_for_new_feature' subroutine does location dependent checking - according to the curation manual, MS14 should be filled in for a new construct, but as leaving it blank won't make the record bounce, until camcur have easy access to the CV terms allowed in this field and more extensive doc on their usage have done the following:

  * if the location peeves is being run matches the proforma 'style' (i.e in this case 'Harvard'), must be filled in for a new insertion

  * otherwise, no error message is printed.
