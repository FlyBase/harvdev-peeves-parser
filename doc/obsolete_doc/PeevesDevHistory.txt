Dear Curators

As of this moment, 
Peeves in production, test and dev are identical.

All of Paul's work is now wrapped together, tested and signed off.
===================================================

This includes correct parsing of G1h, GA1h, A1h and BA1h fields for Cambridge Curators.

We are in process of developing an SOP for a regular Peeves development and testing cycle so watch this space.

NEW testPeeves ready for testing...

Gillian and I went through the differences between test and production Peeves and these have been merged (actually quite straightforward changes).


Production Peeves
-----------------------
No changes

Test Peeves
---------------
A merge of previous production Peeves, and test Peeves, which had almost been signed off. However in the intervening time many changes were made to production Peeves while test languished. Now all of these changes, as well as the work on test (for X1h) are included.
Test needs to be tested against the last test files you were working on.

If possible, please can you use testPeeves instead of Peeves.
Until it is signed off I cannot start work on the Jira tickets!

LIST OF  CHANGES
top level
Peeves/README_running_Peeves now contains more information about config files
Peeves/README has also been updated to describe the directories and basic config file descriptions
--------------------------------------
Peeves - same, except for comments and version change Peeves.pl changed to Peeves in dev

(For these files, File means file.pl)

Aberration
- production version used with A1h items added. This goes hand in hand with the test version of tools.pl
Allele
-production version used with A1h items added. as above, validate A1h replaced from test and sanity checks now in tools.pl
Balancer
-test version used
Chado, Multipub, Publication - no changes
Gene
-as Allele but for G1h
Moseg and natTE and Ti
-as production
Tools and Symtab
- keep test

The new version runs, so test (old) is archived and now all dev files have been moved to test.
Both test and dev now committed to svn
The old Peeves/test is archived for convenience (same as dev) on malibu:/home/hif22/svn/dev and kyala:/export/Peeves/test_archive_temp


When you are happy I'll notify the HARVARD curators or dev - let me know.

Subject: Peeves changes 081204

Once again, what was test Peeves has become production Peeves and the
old dev Peeves is now the test version.  The SVN master and the
Cambridge installation has already been updated.  Harvsys will update
their installation shortly.

Here are the changes made since 081127:

Production Peeves
=================

Full testing of G1h data is performed.  That is, if this field contains
anything, it must be a valid FBgn which corresponds to the gene symbol
given in G1a.  Full validation against the data held in Chado is
performed.  No check is made for G1e and/or G1f being empty if G1h
contains data --- this is a known bug which is fixed in test Peeves.

A .edit record must contain at least one !c editing field somewhere in
its proforma(e) or a warning will be issued.  Absence of a !c is not
strictly an error for a .edit record but it's thought to be sufficiently
unusual to be worth flagging.  This decision can be reviewed if too many
false positives are produced.

A .bibl record may contain either an arbitrary number of multipub
proformae or precisely one publication proforma and no other proformae
of any type.

The P41 field no longer needs to have data for the "unattributed"
publication, though if data is present it will be checked as normal.

Gillian found an important bug in MA1f, MS1f and Te1F checking such that
misleading false negatives could be produced.  As fixing this bug
requires the careful specification of how to check several other fields,
these checks have been disabled and all versions of Peeves now
explicitly warn of this on standard error.  Writing the necessary specs
is scheduled for the upcoming docathon.


Test Peeves
===========

The remaining "Cambridge" FBid fields (GA1h, A1h and AB1h) are checked
analogously to G1h.  All were improved substantially following feedback
from Gillian and Gary.

An extra name space, 'clone_qualifier' was added to FBcv some months ago
but not to the GA28a, GA28b, GA29a and GA29b fields where it was needed
for correct checking.  This has now been fixed by Gillian.

The checks for various obsolete proforma fields have been removed from
Peeves.  The only known fossils are those publication proforma checks
which are still needed for the BMZ trawl.


Development Peeves
==================

At the time of writing dev Peeves is the same as test Peeves.  It is
likely to remain so for at least a week while the documentation is
rewritten.


Documentation
=============

Significant tidying of the files in Peeves/doc/ has taken place in
preparation for next week's docathon.  I expect that most if not all of
the Peeves activity will take place in that directory next week.

Once again, what was test Peeves has become production Peeves and the

Cambridge installation has already been updated.  Harvsys will update
their installation shortly.

Here are the changes made since 081120:

Production Peeves
=================

All vestiges of 2-column curator-config support have been removed

Filename checking on Harvard records has been made much stricter.  The
fourth component may only be a date stamp consisting of 6 digits in
YYMMDD format.  This change ensures that Peeves ignores editor backup
files, etc.

'unattributed' is now allowed as valid data in P22.  Previously it would
generate an unhelpful warning message.

Remove unwanted debugging messages on stderr when Chado doesn't have
authors (P12) data for the FBrf being checked.  This is arguably a Chado
bug but that's not really any of Peeves' business.

Remove unwanted debugging messages on stderr when P22 is empty (i.e. a
new publication is being added to the database) and when either or both
of P3 and P4 are empty.

No cross-checking of P21/P2 or checking of P3 and P4 is performed for a
wider range of data types (such as "DNA/RNA sequence record" and
"curated genome annotation").

Basic X1h checking for FBal, FBab and FBba has been added.  The data
must either be empty, the word "new", or FBal, FBab or FBba as
appropriate followed by 7 digits.  No check is yet made to see whether
the data is valid.

All the retired MP fields have been ripped out of multipub checking, so
old proformae will generate error messages.  It's rather unlikely that
this change will affect anybody.  The retired publication fields
continue to be checked because the BMZ pipeline still needs them.

The restriction that data in MP11 is to be entered only for book
multipubs is now enforced.  The corresponding restriction for MP6 is not
yet implemented.


Test Peeves
===========

Full testing of G1h data is performed.  That is, if this field contains
anything, it must be a valid FBgn which corresponds to the gene symbol
given in G1a.  Full validation against the data held in Chado is

Development Peeves
==================

At the time of writing dev Peeves is the same as test Peeves.

The MP6 change noted above still needs implementing.

Assuming the G1h implementation in test Peeves survives stress-testing,
the other GA1h, A1h and AB1h fields will be fully tested.

Requests for other bug fixes and enhancements are welcome but Peeves
development may not continue at quite such a fast pace as it has over
the last month because other calls on my time are piling up.

Here are the changes made since 081106:

Production Peeves
=================

Counting of elements in a hash list rewritten and, incidentally, a
serious bug fixed which a Harvard currec unearthed.

G1h field (i.e. FBgn data) now recognized but the validity of the data
not yet checked against Chado.

A2c and A9 fields are no longer mandatory.

Bugs fixed in cross-checking G1a/G1e and G1a/G1f validity.

G34 data must be empty or one of 'monoclonal' and 'polyclonal'

2-column curator-config files no longer supported and an error message
generated if one is discovered.

Development Peeves
==================

At the time of writing dev Peeves is the same as test Peeves.

The highest priority work is to check X1h (FBid) data for validity and
consistency with Chado.

I still hope to be able to work on the MA20 and MA1f issues identified
by Gillian in a previous round of testing.

The MP6 change noted above needs implementing.

A .bibl record should contain either a publication proforma and nothing
else, or a sequence of one or more multipub proformae.  A check to
enforce the absence of any other type of proforma will be implemented
ITFOT

An .edit record should contain at least one !c.  A check to enforce this
will be implemented ITFOT.

Once again, what was test Peeves has become production Peeves and the
old dev Peeves is now the test version.  The SVN master copy and the
Cambridge installation has already been updated.  Harvsys will update
their copy shortly.

Most changes apply equally to Harvard and Cambridge but there are a few
things which will affect each differently.

Camcur: the new production Peeves can use either the old style 2-column
or the new style 3-column forms of the curator config file.  You've
already been told about the new format and, as Harvard have no need to
learn about the old one it won't be mentioned further.  The next version
will drop support for the old style.  You have been warned.

Harvcur: the new production Peeves will be the one you'll be using and
is exactly the same as the one which Harvsys has been experimenting with
so far.  Harvsys will handle the set-up at Harvard and first-line
technical support about installation and usage questions.  Questions
about how to interpret Peeves reports should be sent to
camcur@morgan.harvard.edu, at least for the time being.  I'm a member of
that list so there's a good chance that I'll be answering most of posts.


Production Peeves
=================

(Mostly copied from my "Peeves changes 081023" mail, which Harvsys
haven't yet seen.)

Numerous internal changes to get Peeves running at Harvard.

There is *very* rudimentary processing of moseg, ti and natTE proformae.
(Camcur: the earlier chattiness has been toned down substantially.)

P40/P41 fields are checked properly, even for .edit and .bibl records.

The GA1e/GA1f/A1e/A1f fields are no longer mandatory.

The A20a field has been removed (see ticket #673)

The G34 field (for antibodies) is recognized as legitimate in proformae.
If there is no data Peeves will quietly ignore the field, otherwise it
will whinge that it doesn't know how to deal with it.

Test Peeves
===========

Counting of elements in a hash list rewritten and, incidentally, a
serious bug fixed which a Harvard currec unearthed.

X1h fields (i.e. FBid data) now recognized but the validity of the data
not yet checked against Chado.

A2c and A9 fields are no longer mandatory.

Bugs fixed in cross-checking G1a/G1e and G1a/G1f validity.

G34 data must be empty or one of 'monoclonal' and 'polyclonal'

Test Peeves checks for an old-style 2-column config file and executes
this Perl statemnent if it finds one.  Even if you don't speak Perl you
should be able to work out well enough what it means:
   die ("$0: old-style curator config file '$ccfg'.  Please update it to new three-column form.\n");


Please check the above statements and send me (relevant 8-) feedback.

Development Peeves
==================

At the time of writing dev Peeves is the same as test Peeves.  The
testing at Harvard has unearthed several deficiencies and inelegancies
which need addressing in the near future.  I hope to be able to work on
the MA20 and MA1f issues identified by Gillian in the previous round of
testing.  All evidence for 2-column curator config support will be
removed.

Now the epicycle is out of the way, what was test Peeves has become
production Peeves and the old dev Peeves is now the test version.
Thanks to Steven and Gillian for performing the necessary testing.

There are quite a few changes to both versions.  Here's a brief summary.
It is brief, honest, despite running to 70 lines or so.


Production Peeves
=================

This now uses all the new P40 and P41 field codes.  P41 must have data
under all circumstances (note that .edit and .bibl records will generate
false positives) and P40 may have data, even in .bibl and .edit records
(so there are false negatives in this circumstance).

Test Peeves
===========

There are many changes between the old and new test versions.  Most of
them should be invisible or, at worst, harmless.  If weird things start
happening I want to know!

There is *very* rudimentary processing of moseg, ti and natTE proformae.
It's quite chatty about what it can't do and if that turns out to be
just too irritating I can turn it off.

P40/P41 fields are checked properly, even for .edit and .bibl records.

The GA1e/GA1f/A1e/A1f fields are no longer mandatory.

The A20a field has been removed (see ticket #673)

The G34 field (for antibodies) is recognized as legitimate in proformae.
If there is no data Peeves will quietly ignore the field, otherwise it
will whinge that it doesn't know how to deal with it.

For all of the above I would appreciate tests being run and comments
made.  I've verified that it does something sensible with all the
records submitted today.

The invisible changes are primarily in preparation for getting Peeves to
run at Harvard, and include things like parsing Harvard file names (in
as much as they are known) and stashing away various properties of each
record type.  A small portion is actually visible --- in P40/P41 parsing
of .bibl and .edit records.

Another invisible change, but one worth giving you a heads-up for, is
that the curation configuration file will change from a 2-column format
to a 3-column version.  The extra column is needed for Harvard curators
and, unexpectedly, turns out to be useful at Cambridge and IU.  To
remind you, the present format has your username in the first column and
the directory containing records in the second.  For example,

gm119	~/records/toberel
rs573	~/records/toberel
sart2	~/records/toberel

The new format has an intermediate column.  For example,

gm119	gm	~/records/toberel
rs573	ra	~/records/toberel
sart2	st|up	~/records/toberel

This new column contains the curator identifier.  Gillian always has
records beginning 'gm'; Ray uses 'ra' and Susan either 'st' or 'up'
according to whether she's submitting her own curation or that from
Uniprot.  I'm also pleased because some rather gruesome kludges can now
be removed from Peeves 8-)

The test version Peeves happily reads both versions in my tests but, I
stress, you do NOT need to change your config files yet if you don't
want to.  On the other hand, if you would like to try out the new
format, please do and let me know of any problems.  Susan may well have
the greatest incentive ...

Development Peeves
==================
At the time of writing dev Peeves is the same as test Peeves.  Next week
I intend to parse the X1h (FBid) fields properly and to re-write the way
in which the number of elements in a hash-list is determined.  The
latter is a prerequisite for the former.  If there are any other
relatively simple changes you'd like to see, possible as a consequence
of using test Peeves, please let me know.
