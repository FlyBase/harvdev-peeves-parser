! IN5b. Stage and tissue ( <e> <t> <a> <s> <note> ) :
<e> <t> E <a> organism <s> <note>
! IN5e. Comments concerning source   :Source was yeast cell line; bait produced as transgenic fusion protein; prey produced as transgenic fusion protein (prey from embryo cDNA expression library).
! IN6.  List of interactors (FB symbol or ids), role (Termlink MI CV), qualifier ( <symbol>  <ID_as_reported>  <role>  <qual/note> ) :
<symbol> siz-XP <ID_as_reported> schizo/loner <role> bait <qual/note> fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain

! IN7c. Subregion(s) of participant(s) with role in interaction ( <link to>  <description> region <role> unspecified role <coordinates/seq>  <note> ) :
<link to> siz-XP <description> N-terminal domain <role> sufficient binding site <coordinates/seq> aa 1-358 <note> 
<link to> siz-XP <description> N-terminal domain <role> necessary binding site <coordinates/seq> aa 1-352 <note> 
! IN7b. Comments concerning experimental data:Two-hybrid system: yeast GAL4-BD/GAL4-AD
! IN7d. Isoform-specific participant(s) with role in interaction :
<link to> siz-XP <description> 1313-kDa isoform <role> bait <note> aa 1-350 construct os siz is refered to by the authors as SchizoP2
<link to> siz-XP <description> 1325-kDa isoform <role> bait <note> aa 1-370 of siz-RB was also tested for binding to CadN and is listed by the authors as SchizoP1.
! IN8a. Public comments   :@siz@-RA and @siz@-RB differ in the first 116 aa but retain conserved domains including the IQ motif.  Since the IQ motif is not required for @CadN@ binding, the authors reason that the shared 207 aa between @siz@-RA and @siz@-RB are essential for binding to @CadN@.

! IN7b. Comments concerning experimental data:Transgenic flies producing each of the @siz@ and @CadN@ fusion constructs were created such that the construct were expressed under the control of a @Mef2@ driver.  Interaction between @siz@ and @CadN@ reconstituted the YFP protein which was then visualized using anti-GFP antibody.  Flies expressing the @siz@ or @CadN@ constructs alone did not show signal when stained with anti-GFP.
