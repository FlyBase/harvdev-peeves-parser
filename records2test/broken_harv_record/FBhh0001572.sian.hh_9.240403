! C3.  Curator notes to self    :This curation record has somehow ended up with an odd character (which appeared in BBEdit Find as \x{A0}) which had crept into a lot of the proforma headers and fields in that record after spaces. This was breaking Peeves so that it was ignoring all the publication proformae. This was generating the following kind of Peeves error, indicating that it was v. unhappy:

FBhh0001572.sian.hh_9.240403: *CRITICAL ERROR* Found proforma of unexpected type 'HUMAN HEALTH MODEL'. You may have missed out a 'parent' proforma (e.g. ALLELE needs to be under a GENE) or got proformae in the wrong order. This could have have VERY bad consequences when loading, please check and *DO NOT LOAD* this curation record until this message disappears.

This is because Peeves expects either a publication/multipub proforma at the top of the record which it was not finding.

The problem was the odd characters in the PUBLICATION PROFORMA header line - removing the odd character solely from those lines (as in FBhh0001572.sian.hh_fixed.240403 in the same folder) fixed the problem. I think its slightly more complex than that though as 258624.tl.skim.24042 in the same folder also has these odd characters in, but Peeves appears to be coping and chopping up the proformae correctly.

So its probably something to do with the fact that this hh one has just the header line and a single field (as the 258624.tl.skim.24042 record has additional publication fields)

! HH15. Overview of Drosophila model (free text)  :This report describes mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC, a subtype of progeria that exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance. The human gene implicated is HGSNAT, which encodes heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, one of several enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of heparin sulfate. There is one high-scoring fly ortholog, Dmel\@Hgsnat@, for which multiple genetic reagents, including classical alleles, RNAi-targeting constructs, and alleles caused by insertional mutagenesis, have been generated. 

Human HGSNAT has not been introduced into flies.

Flies mutant for @Hgsnat@ exhibit a progressive accumulation of heparin sulfuate; this is also observed in flies undergoing ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dmel\@Hgsnat@. Ubiquituous RNAi-mediated knockdown also results in a significantly shortened lifespan. Pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dmel\@Hgsnat@ results in enlargement of the endolysosomal compartment in the brain, presynaptic abnormalities, and locomotor defects. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dmel\@Hgsnat@ in cortex and wrapping glia resulted in climbing defects in adult flies, while knockdown in sub-perineurial glia and astrocytes impaired activity in an activity monitor assay.

! HH4h. Description of process (free text) :
! HH4a. Description/Symptoms and phenotype (free text)  :Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) is a multisystem lysosomal storage disease characterized by progressive central nervous system degeneration manifest as severe intellectual disability (ID), developmental regression, and other neurologic manifestations including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), behavioral problems, and sleep disturbances. Disease onset is typically before age ten years. Disease course may be rapidly or slowly progressive; some individuals with an extremely attenuated disease course present in mid-to-late adulthood with early-onset dementia with or without a history of ID. Systemic manifestations can include musculoskeletal problems (joint stiffness, contractures, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia), hearing loss, respiratory tract and sinopulmonary infections, and cardiac disease (valvular thickening, defects in the cardiac conduction system). Neurologic decline is seen in all affected individuals; however, clinical severity varies within and among the four MPS III subtypes (defined by the enzyme involved) and even among members of the same family. Death usually occurs in the second or third decade of life secondary to neurologic regression or respiratory tract infections. [from GeneReviews, Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III; 2024.04.03]
