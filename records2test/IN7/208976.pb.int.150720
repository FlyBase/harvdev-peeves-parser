! IN7b. Comments concerning experimental data:
! IN8a. Public comments   :The interaction detailed in this paper is between two isoforms of @Mef2@ that contain point mutations (@Mef2@ 30-5 and @Mef2@ 44-5) that affect the gene regulation activity of the protein homo-dimer.  To determine if a physical interaction between @Mef2@ 30-5 and @Mef2@ 44-5 is possible, Lovato et al. carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using either full length @Mef2@ protein or a truncated version, or a mixture of both proteins that had been synthesized in the same in vitro reaction. When mixed with the @Mef2@ binding site from Act57B, the individual full length and truncated isoforms generated shifted bands that were consistent with their ability to interact with DNA, and consistent with their respective sizes.  The truncated isoform bound to DNA had a greater mobility than the full length @Mef2@-DNA complex. When the mixture of full length and truncated @Mef2@ was incubated with the DNA probe, a band of intermediate mobility was also observed. This band must represent an heterodimer of full lengthand truncated protein interacting with DNA.
