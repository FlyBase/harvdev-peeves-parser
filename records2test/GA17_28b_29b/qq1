! GA14. Internal notes                                              *W :?? Previously, curators could use use "use terms from gene_ontology.obo that are descendants of the term 'cell cycle ; GO:0007049'" to "specify cell cycle defects".  We've decided to stop this policy and peeves needs to report an error if such a term is used.   All entries in GA17, GA28b and GA29b here should generate a Peeves error.
