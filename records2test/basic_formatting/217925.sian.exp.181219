! F15. General expression comment [free text] :@Scer\GAL4[ppk25.PS]@ transcript is detected by RLM-RACE in male prothoracic legs, but not in adult heads from which the antennae had been removed. @Scer\GAL4[ppk25.PS]@ drives expression in a small subset of gustatory and olfactory receptor neurons, some of which have been implicated in male courtship behavior, and which coexpress @fru@. Expression is observed in a subset of neurons innervating the taste hairs of both male and female legs and wings, but in no other body parts. @Scer\GAL4[ppk25.PS]@ is limited to one gustatory neuron per leg taste bristle. Expression is also observed in olfactory neurons that project from antennal segment three to antennal lobes VA1v or VL2a. Expression does not overlap with that of @CheB42a@ protein.
