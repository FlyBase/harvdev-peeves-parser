At 22[o]C, co-expression of @Gbp1[Scer\UAS.cKa]@ or @Gbp2[Scer\UAS.cKa]@ partially suppresses the body size decreases, slower larval growth rate, and increased duration of the third instar larval stage (L3) seen in animals with @Tsc1[Scer\UAS.cUa]@ and @gig[Scer\UAS.cUa]@ driven by @Scer\GAL4[C7]@ (though body size, larval growth rate and duration of L3 is still significantly reduced compared to wild type).
