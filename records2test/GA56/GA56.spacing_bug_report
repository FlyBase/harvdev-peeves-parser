A. spacing errors
=================
(fake curation record = gm070227 in ~gm119/peeves_test)
(peeves output file = GA56_space_test)

1. I wrote the following in

' semi-viable '

and got these error messages:

gm070227: GA56: superfluous leading whitespace in ' semi-viable '

gm070227: GA56: superfluous trailing whitespace in 'semi-viable '


NOTE that the top error message gives the whole line in the '', i.e. ' semi-viable ' but
 the second one has thrown away the leading whitespace in 'semi-viable '
 - probably doesn't matter much, but it isn't consistent.

2. We need to have the WHOLE phenotypic class line reported always for
errors of spacing in this field, here are two examples why (at the
moment we are only getting parts of the line reported - I can see why
as thats where the extra white space is, but it makes for a confusing
report and makes it really hard to find the line that is actually
causing the error).

a. I wrote the following:

visible  | recessive | maternal effect

which has an extra space after the visible

it gives this error message:

gm070227: GA56: superfluous trailing whitespace in 'visible '

it would be MUCH more helpful if the error message gave the entire line, i.e.:

gm070227: GA56: superfluous trailing whitespace in 'visible  | recessive | maternal effect'


(the phrase 'visible ' could be in free text or any of the many GA56. in a real proforma)


or maybe this is better - it gives where the extra whitespace is first AND then the whole line so its easy to find !

gm070227: GA56: superfluous trailing whitespace in 'visible ' in 'visible  | recessive | maternal effect'


b. I wrote the following:

(with bw[2])  paralytic | pupal stage

it gave me this error:

gm070227: GA56: superfluous leading whitespace in ' paralytic | pupal stage'

this is another good example where we really need to have the whole phenotypic class line in the error report - I actually had to change the test proforma, because in the first instance I had  two lines with 'paralytic | pupal stage' in various forms and I did not know which line was giving me the error without having the whole line to look at.

So we need the error report to say:


gm070227: GA56: superfluous leading whitespace in '(with bw[2])  paralytic | pupal stage'

or maybe:

gm070227: GA56: superfluous leading whitespace in ' paralytic | pupal stage' in '(with bw[2])  paralytic | pupal stage'


(there were similar examples involving dodgy spacing in the (with ) part and in the {})
