Notes on fields

! F1f. Database id (default 'new')   :new
        -required
        -if the feature already exists in flybase then enter its flybase id (i.e. FBpp or FBtr)

! F1a. Gene product symbol           :
       = equivalent to GAT1a. GAP1a. OB1a.                    
       -required (provides a double check if the feature is in the database already
       -transcript and protein symbols are gene_symbol-XR and gene_symbol-XP for basic info
 
! F3.  Gene product type [CV]        :
        -only required if a new feature
        - usually 'polypeptide' or 'mRNA' but could be other types of transcripts
          eg. 'miRNA', 'ncRNA', 'rRNA', 'snRNA', 'snoRNA','tRNA' 

! F2.  Sequence attribute [CV]	     :synthetic_sequence SO:0000351
	Necessary for reporters; do not use for wild-type expression

! F4. Names(s) used in paper [free text] :
       = GAT1b. GAP1b. OB1e. 
       -optional and not used much as most of this gets done with gene synoyms
        and as this version is not set up to capture isoforms unlikely to use

! F5. Molecule size(s) (wb, nb, sa)      :
        this should be a controlled string listing all the identified sizes of molecule
        species in conjunction with how they were identified.

        sizes should be listed in descending order grouped by assay
        more than one assay can be grouped together if the sizes identified 
        apply to both assays

        examples:
        4.8, 4.3, 4.1, 4.0, 3.5, 3.2, 2.6 (nb) => 7 transcripts of the indicated sizes were
                                                             identified via northern analysis
        2.3 (nb, compiled cDNA) => a 2.3 kb transcript was identified by northern and a 
                                              cDNA sequence was compiled

        assays:
        northern blot (nb)
        cDNA length
        compiled cDNA
        sequence analysis (sa)
        western blot (wb)


! F9. Expression pattern (<e>  <t>  <a>  <s>  <note>) :

You can have multiple lines of grouped cv terms to describe expression patterns.

Tag explanations:
<e> the assay used to determine expression from an assay cv (we will likely use short
        abbreviations and have them converted to full cvterm)

current abbreviations can be found at: 
file:///users/ftpuser/CUR/curation_guidelines/interaction_pathway_CVs.html#assay_CV

<t> a term from the FBdv CV - we still need to determine if we can use shorthand and describe
        multiple stages in a single term

<a> a term from the FBbt CV - full term names and qualifiers - we need to make sure a convention is
        established for this.

<s> a term from the GO cellular component and qualifiers?

<c> a term describing microtime like cell cycle and circadian time (need a CV source FBcv?)

<note> a comment that is specific to that particular tag line
        within this comment surrounding a block of text with open and close cv tags means that 
        the comment is specific for that tag eg. <s>your comment here</s> is a subcellular specific
        comment

Adding complexity to these statements -

1. in the <t> field you can use temporal shorthand cv with ranges of stages 
        eg. <t> E | stage 10-14 = embryonic stage 10, embryonic stage 11 ... embryonic stage 14
        we will make a correspondance mapping table
        NOTE: it is best to avoid using hour terms if possible

        embryonic shorthand cv: 
        file:///users/ftpuser/CUR/curation_guidelines/interaction_pathway_CVs.html#temporal_CV
        
2. you can use multiple cv terms in each field - see TAP documentation
        https://cedar.bio.indiana.edu/trac/env/ontologies

! F15. General expression comment [free text] :
        this is a comment that applies to any and all expression lines

! F10. Used as bodypart marker for [CV] :
if the protein/transcript or reporter is used as a marker for an anatomical structure
then use the FBbt CV terms to capture this here

! F11. Expression pattern ascribed to (gene symbol) :
Used for reporter constructs.
        ! F11a. Is subset of wild-type gene expression pattern (y/n) :
if a reporter expression pattern is stated to reflect the expression pattern of a gene then
that gene symbol goes in this field - if the pattern only reflects a subset of the wild-type
expression pattern of the gene then F11a should be marked as 'y'
        !     F11b. Is pattern aberrant relative to wild-type (y/n) :n

! F91. From dataset/collection (symbol) :
	
	DESCRIPTION.
	The field designates the geneproduct as part of a set defined by some dataset/collection.
	FIELD TYPE.
	Identifier.
	REQUIRED ENTRY.
	No.
	SINGLE/MULTIPLE ENTRY?
	Single. For multiple entries (rare), use a separate proforma record.
	!c APPLICABLE?
	No.
	VALID FORMAT.
	Current name for a "Large Dataset Metadata" (aka library/collection).
	OTHER COMMENTS.
	The F91 field creates a "library_feature" relationship. The dependent F91a field creates a "library_featureprop" that specifies the kind of library_feature relationship.
	DEPENDENT FIELDS.
	F91a. If F91 is used to associate a geneproduct and dataset/collection, F91a must be used to specify the type of relationship. See F91a documentation.
	UPDATED.
	gds130730.

! F91a. Type of relationship to dataset/collection [member_of_reagent_collection/experimental_result] :
	
	DESCRIPTION.
	The field specifies how the geneproduct is related to the dataset/collection specified in the dependent F91 field.
	FIELD TYPE.
	CV.
	REQUIRED ENTRY.
	No. Required only if a dataset/collection is specified in the dependent F91 field.
	SINGLE/MULTIPLE ENTRY?
	Single. For multiple entries (rare), use a separate proforma record.
	!c APPLICABLE?
	No.
	VALID FORMAT.
	Current valid entries from the “library_featureprop type” CV are:
	member_of_reagent_collection
	experimental_result
	OTHER COMMENTS.
	The F91a field creates a “library_featureprop” that describes how the geneproduct is related to the dataset/collection specified in F91. In the past, -XR gene products have been linked to 'gene expression cluster' datasets: no library_featureprop has been specified for these 'result'-type links. However, we are currently reviewing the best way to group 'results' related to dataset/metadata objects.
	DEPENDENT FIELDS.
	F91. F91a is only used if a dataset/collection is specified in F91.
	UPDATED.
